                                  ORDER ON CHARGE

           Introduction:

      1.                    At the outset, it is appropriate to record that the
           investigating agency, namely the Central Bureau of Investigation
           (hereinafter referred to as “CBI”), has filed one principal charge-sheet
           together with four supplementary charge-sheets in the present matter.
           For the purposes of clarity, uniformity and ease of reference, the
           accused persons, as enumerated hereinabove, shall hereinafter referred
           to as Accused Nos. “A-1 to A-23” respectively, unless the context
           otherwise requires. The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 shall

 CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 2 of 549
       hereinafter referred to as “PC Act, 1988”. M/S Brindco Sales Private
       Limited shall be referred to as “M/S BSPL”, M/S Khao Gali
       Restaurant Private Limited as “ M/S KGRL”, Pernod Ricard India
       Private Limited as “M/S PRI”, and the code of Criminal Procedure,
       1973 as “Cr. P.C.”

  2.                       The allegations sought to be projected by the CBI, as
       emanating from the aforesaid charge-sheet and the supplementary
       charge-sheets, are set out and examined in the paragraphs that follow.
       It is clarified that the facts set out in the chargesheets are noted herein
       in brief. The detailed particulars, with requisite specificity, shall be
       examined under the respective heads of allegations while evaluating
       and analyzing the material placed on record by the Investigating
       Agency and the role attributed to each accused.

       Main Charge sheet, dated 24.11.2022 (filed on 25.11.2022)

  3.                       According to the prosecution, as set out in FIR No.
       RC0032022A0053 dated 17.08.2022, lodged by CBI/ACB, New Delhi
       on the complaint of Shri Praveen Kumar Rai, Director, Ministry of
       Home Affairs, certain public servants of the Excise Department,
       GNCTD, acting in concert with private individuals and liquor
       businessmen, entered into a criminal conspiracy during the framing
       and implementation of the Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22 (hereinafter
       referred to as “DEP-21/22”). It is alleged that this arrangement was
       intended to secure unlawful pecuniary advantage for themselves and
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 3 of 549
       for favoured private entities, thereby attracting offences under Section
       120-B of the Indian Penal Code (hereinafter referred to as “IPC”) read
       with Sections 7, 7A and 8 of the PC Act, 1988.

  4.                       The policy, brought into force on 05.07.2021, is stated to
       have been designed to curb monopoly and cartel formation by
       separating the functions of manufacturer, wholesaler (L-1 licensee)
       and retail zone licensee. The tender conditions barred wholesalers
       from holding or funding retail licences and imposed restrictions on
       entities with overlapping directors or controlling shareholding across
       manufacturing, wholesale or retail entities. Retail zones were to be
       allotted by e-tender against substantial participation fees and Earnest
       Money Deposits (hereinafter referred to as “EMD”), and a Tender
       Evaluation Committee (hereinafter referred to as “TEC”) was
       constituted for scrutiny of bids. Twenty zones were awarded in the first
       round; twelve remained and were tendered afresh, in which M/S
       KGRL emerged as H-1 for Zones 2 and 3, leading to issuance of letters
       of award with the approval of the then Deputy Chief Minister.

  5.                       The case put forward is that in May/June 2021, at the
       instance of A-3, a meeting was held at Gauri Apartments near
       Claridges Hotel, Delhi. It is stated that approver PW-20; Dinesh Arora,
       A-4, A-5 and others attended the meeting. The liquor policy was
       discussed and it was indicated that 7–10 retail zones in Delhi would
       be taken by the group. A-3 is stated to have introduced approver

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 4 of 549
       PW-20 as his close associate who would deal with excise matters in
       Delhi, coordinate with the others and keep him informed. It is alleged
       that between 18–20 June 2021, another meeting took place at ITC
       Kohenoor, Hyderabad, attended by the same persons. During this
       meeting, it was stated that ₹20–30 crores would be sent by A-4 to A-3
       in Delhi, and that approver PW-20 would coordinate the transfer.
       Reliance is placed on hotel records to show their presence during this
       period. It is stated that in the said meeting it was decided that the
       wholesale distributorship in Delhi of M/S PRI and M/S DIAGEO
       would go to M/S Indospirits of A-7 and M/S BSPL of A-9, enabling
       these entities to earn the 12% wholesale margin on Indian Made
       Foreign Liquor (hereinafter referred to as “IMFL”). It is contended
       that the amount of ₹20–30 crores, described as “upfront money”, was
       to be adjusted through business arrangements. A 65% partnership of
       A-5 in M/S Indospirits was to be secured. Further, 6% out of the 12%
       margin of M/S BSPL was to be returned by way of credit notes to retail
       zones controlled by A-4 and, after repayment, shared equally between
       A-4 and A-3. Approver PW-20 was assured a 25% share in M/S
       Indospirits, though no such share was ultimately given, and was told
       that he would be accommodated in future. It is stated that between July
       and September 2021, ₹20–30 crores were sent in cash through hawala
       channels to A-3 and his associates. A-4 is said to have communicated




CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                   Page no. 5 of 549
       phone numbers and currency note details to Approver PW-20, who
       would pass the same to the team of A-3.

  6.                       It is further alleged that A-3 used his influence to
       pressurize M/S PRI not to appoint M/S BSPL as its distributor in Delhi
       and to instead appoint M/S Indospirits, despite reservations about
       Indospirits’ past financial record. A meeting is stated to have been held
       on 20.09.2021 at Hotel Taj Mansingh, New Delhi, attended by officials
       of M/S PRI along with A-7, A-5 and A-4, wherein the latter two
       allegedly projected themselves as investors in M/S Indospirits with
       support from prominent business houses in the South. Following this,
       M/S PRI appointed M/S Indospirits as its wholesale distributor and
       granted brand registrations.

  7.                       Regarding public servants, the charge-sheet alleges that
       A-1 (then Deputy Commissioner, IMFL) and A-2 (then Assistant
       Commissioner, IMFL) became part of the conspiracy while dealing
       with M/S Indospirits’ L-1 licence and in handling complaints relating
       to alleged cartelisation and cross-funding. Indospirits’ first L-1
       application dated 09.09.2021 drew certain deficiency memos, and a
       complaint dated 18.10.2021 alleging cartel practices and blacklisting
       was received. It is alleged that A-1 directed that important allegations
       concerning “cross-funding/EMD funding” of M/S KGRL by M/S
       Indospirits not be included in the show-cause notice and that no



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 6 of 549
       meaningful enquiry was undertaken. M/S Indospirits then sought
       withdrawal of this application, which was allowed on 05.11.2021.

  8.                       The prosecution states that a second L-1 application
       dated 29.10.2021, substantially similar in structure, was processed
       unusually swiftly on 05.11.2021, the first working day after Diwali,
       notwithstanding the pendency of related proceedings before the
       Hon’ble Supreme Court and the subsisting allegations of cartelisation.
       It is alleged that the file contained deficiencies and that the Section
       Officer and Assistant Section Officer had proposed issuance of a
       deficiency memo, but A-2 directed them not to issue it, stating that he
       would obtain the necessary documents himself. It is claimed that the
       documents were then inserted into the file on the same day, without
       any covering letter or proper receipt, at a time when A-7 was present
       in the Excise office. A note was thereafter prepared, and with the
       approval of A-1, the L-1 licence was granted on the same day. In this
       context, the prosecution alleges that A-7 caused ₹30 lakhs to be paid
       as illegal gratification to A-2, on the instructions of A-3 and with the
       involvement of approver (PW-20) Dinesh Arora, for securing and
       expediting the licence.

  9.                       The charge-sheet further asserts that the anti-cartel
       provisions of the policy were deliberately undermined by permitting
       and concealing cross-funding between M/S Indospirits (wholesaler)
       and M/S KGRL (retailer). It is alleged that during the first round of

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 7 of 549
        bidding, ₹10.80 crores were transferred from the account of M/S
        Indospirit Marketing Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as
        “IMPL”) to the account of M/S KGRL, and demand drafts towards
        EMD were prepared out of the said amount. It is stated that in the
        second round of bidding, twelve demand drafts of ₹10 lakhs each
        towards application fee were prepared from the account of M/S
        KGRL, after transferring funds in two instalments of ₹60 lakhs each
        from M/S IMPL. It is further stated that a demand draft of ₹5 crores
        towards EMD was prepared from the account of M/S KGRL after
        money was transferred in three instalments from M/S IMPL. The
        authorised signatory and net banking operator of the bank accounts of
        M/S IMPL are stated to be A-7, his wife and his father.

  10.                      On the financial front, it is alleged that between
        November 2021 and September 2022, M/S Indospirits recorded a
        turnover of about ₹1,333 crores, earning gross margins of around ₹111
        crores and net distributable profits of ₹47.68 crores, of which nearly
        61% (₹29.29 crores) was transferred to or for the benefit of A-5, far
        exceeding his declared investment and share in the joint venture. The
        prosecution refers to complex fund movements from M/S Indospirits
        to A-5, and from him to A-6 and companies associated with A-4,
        including media and broadcasting firms such as India Ahead News
        Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “IANPL”), Andhra Prabha
        Publication Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “APPL”), CDG

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                    Page no. 8 of 549
        Broadcasting Pvt. Ltd. and Zeus Networking Pvt. Ltd. Certain “loan
        agreements” produced to explain these transfers are alleged to be
        sham, with employees stating that they were made to sign without
        understanding the contents. These transactions, according to the
        prosecution, represent the routing and utilisation of proceeds
        generated from the alleged excise policy scheme.

  11.                      On this foundation, supported, according to the main
        charge-sheet, by witness statements (including that of approver Dinesh
        Arora), banking and corporate records, digital material, CDRs, hotel
        documents and other seized articles, seven persons have been arrayed
        as accused A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4, A-5 A-6 and A-7. It is also stated that
        the requisite sanction for prosecution under Section 19 of the PC Act,
        1988 has been granted in respect of accused public servants A-1 and
        A-2.

        First Supplementary Charge-sheet, dated 25.04.2023 (filed on
        25.04.2023)

  12.                      In the first supplementary charge-sheet, the prosecution
        maintains that A-8, the then Deputy Chief Minister and was heading
        the Excise Department in concert with certain public servants and
        private individuals to improperly influence the framing and
        implementation of the DEP-21/22. It is alleged that the policy was
        steered in a manner intended to benefit a select group of liquor,
        wholesalers and retailers, in return for unlawful gratification.
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 9 of 549
  13.                      The prosecution case is that an Expert Committee
        headed by Sh. Ravi Dhawan submitted its report on 13.10.2020
        recommending continued Government control over wholesale,
        complete privatization of retail vends to individual and allotted
        through lottery and other safeguards to prevent cartelisation.
        According to the CBI, this report was not processed in the normal
        course and was kept aside, as A-8 allegedly intended to follow a
        different model favouring private entities. Public comments were
        invited from 31.12.2020 to 21.01.2021. During this period, it is alleged
        that PW-92 Zakir Khan helped generate fabricated “public feedback”
        emails at the behest of A-8, to create an impression of public support
        for allotment of retail liquor licence through auction, reduction of
        Excise and VAT as well as enhancement of license fee and increase
        in number of liquor vends.

  14.                      A draft Cabinet Note dated 28.01.2021 was thereafter
        prepared, containing the Expert Committee report, public feedback
        and legal opinions from Hon’ble Justice (Retd.) Ranjan Gogoi,
        Hon’ble Justice (Retd.) K.G. Balakrishnan and Senior Advocate Shri
        Mukul Rohatgi obtained by Delhi ALCOBEV Retailer Association, all
        of whom are stated to be in favour of status quo. This file, allegedly,
        was never placed before the Council of Ministers and subsequently
        went missing. Based on the file-movement register, witness statements



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                     Page no. 10 of 549
        and digital material, the CBI alleges that the file was last in the
        conscious possession of A-8 and was deliberately removed.

  15.                      It is further alleged that after the disappearance of this
        file, a fresh note was initiated on 02.02.2021, omitting the earlier legal
        opinions, and directions were given to the then Excise Commissioner
        to prepare a new Cabinet Note aligned with A-8 preferred model. On
        05.02.2021, a Group of Ministers (hereinafter be referred to as
        “GoM”) was approved to frame the new regime headed by A-8.
        Although several meetings were claimed to have taken place, no
        formal minutes were maintained and even the Excise Commissioner
        was largely kept out of the core deliberations. Forensic examination of
        computers seized from the office of the Deputy Chief Minister
        allegedly yielded various draft GoM reports, in which he is shown as
        the main author, with edits attributed to him by witnesses. In the
        second draft GoM report dated 19.03.2021, the wholesale margin was
        abruptly increased from 5% to 12% and the eligibility criteria for
        turnover for wholesaler was also increased from Rs. 100 Crore to Rs.
        500 Crore, every year for past 5 years, which is based upon the printout
        of 36 pages taken by member of south group and handed over to A-3
        which was further handed over to A-8.

  16.                      Relying on these drafts, it is alleged that A-8 introduced
        key policy changes, in final GoM report dated 22.03.2021, including
        raising the wholesale margin to 12%, relaxing eligibility norms,

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 11 of 549
        diluting the related-entity restriction and reviving the zonal licensing
        system, and turnover criteria was reduced to Rs. 250 Crore every year
        for past 3 years, contrary to Expert Committee recommendations.
        These changes are alleged to have been made to favour a lobby of
        liquor businessmen referred to as the “South Group”, in pursuance of
        a prior understanding.

  17.                      It is stated that emphasis on the alleged role of A-3 as
        the intermediary between A-8 and the South Group. It is alleged that
        he, along with A-4, A-5, A-6 and A-23, negotiated illegal gratification
        of ₹90-100 crores, part of which was to be routed through hawala.
        Meetings at various hotels and travel records are cited to support this
        allegation. It is further alleged that a draft of the GoM report was
        photocopied at Hotel Oberoi, as reflected in the photocopy logs.

  18.                      A-7 of M/S Indospirits is described as a major
        beneficiary. The prosecution claims that M/S Indospirits was
        structured to represent the South Group, with A-5 holding beneficial
        interest on their behalf. To address cross-ownership concerns, the
        resignation and later induction of Smt. Geetika Mahendru into M/S
        Indospirits are stated to have been used to conceal links with retail
        entities. M/S Indospirits allegedly earned profits of ₹29.29 crores,
        forming part of the funds circulated as bribe money. It is alleged that
        A-3 in the meeting at Hotel Taj on 01.03.2021 with Sh. I.P. Suresh



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 12 of 549
        Menon (PW-101) demanded undue gratification for favourable
        clauses

  19.                      The prosecution also relies on banking records, credit-
        note ledgers and fund flows. A-9 is alleged to have issued un-
        authorised credit notes amounting to ₹4.97 crores to retail firms out of
        which 2.58 Crore to retail firm linked with the South Group, enabling
        cash generation for hawala transfers. Payments from M/S Indospirits
        to media companies linked with A-6 and A-10 are described as sham
        transactions intended to layer the proceeds of crime.

  20.                      A-11 is alleged to have assisted the South Group
        incorporating favorable clauses and to have been involved in policy-
        draft discussions. A confidential Excise Department tender document
        recovered from him is cited to suggest unauthorised access to official
        records.

  21.                      The prosecution further alleges destruction of electronic
        evidence, stating that two mobile phones used by A-8 during the
        relevant period were discarded shortly before he was summoned,
        thereby attracting Section 201 IPC. Digital evidence, such as
        recovered draft policy files, email headers of feedback, WhatsApp
        chats and metadata indicating authorship of drafts, has been produced
        with Section 65-B certification. Sanction for prosecution of the
        concerned public servants has also been obtained.


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 13 of 549
  22.                      On this basis, the prosecution asserts that a prima facie
        case exists that A-8, accused public servants A-1 and A-2, A-3, South
        Group members A-4, A-5, A-6 and A-11, and other private accused
        persons including A-7, A-9 and A-10, entered into a conspiracy
        punishable under Sections 120-B, 420 and 201 of IPC and the
        provisions of Section 7, 7A, 8 and 12 of the PC Act, 1988 to
        manipulate the excise policy for wrongful gain and to conceal or
        destroy material evidence.

        Second Supplementary Charge-sheet (Final Report No. 03), dated
        08.07.2023 (filed on 10.07.2023)

  23.                      The second supplementary charge-sheet (Final Report
        No. 03) dated 08.07.2023 was filed under Section 173 of Cr.P.C in
        continuation of the earlier charge-sheets already submitted in the same
        FIR.

  24.                      The prosecution case is that the DEP-21/22 was
        allegedly manipulated and tweaked with a preconceived design to
        extend undue benefit to certain private persons/entities described as
        the “South Group” and allied intermediaries. It is alleged that such
        purported policy favour was extended in consideration of illegal
        gratification quantified by the agency at approximately ₹90–100
        crores, allegedly paid for the benefit of A-3, described as an associate
        of A-8. It is further alleged that part of the said illegal gratification was
        arranged and routed through hawala/angadiya channels and utilised
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 14 of 549
        for political campaign expenditure, including the Goa Assembly
        Election campaign of 2022.

  25.                      In substance, the supplementary report alleges that
        members of the so-called “South Group”, including A-5, A-4, A-6 and
        their Chartered Accountant/associate A-11, paid illegal gratification
        for being favoured under the policy framework. The alleged policy
        benefits include, inter-alia, enhancement of the wholesaler margin
        from 5% to 12%, adoption of a model allegedly restricting distribution
        to “one wholesaler per manufacturer”, zonal structuring and
        auctioning of vends, and the creation of commercial mechanisms such
        as rebates or credit-notes linked to up-front payments. It is alleged that
        inputs attributed to such private persons found reflection in official
        recommendations and/or appeared in substance in GoM-related
        material, which, according to the prosecution, indicates a direct role of
        south group in policy shaping.

  26.                      It is further alleged that A-9, connected with M/S BSPL,
        facilitated interactions and meetings between A-3 and certain
        stakeholders/manufacturers, and that through business arrangements,
        including additional credit-notes and other transfers, funds were
        generated and channelled, allegedly by way of commission sharing
        and cash transfers, for the benefit of the “South Group” and for onward
        movement through informal channels.

  27.                      A central plank of the present supplementary report is
        the alleged diversion and utilisation of a substantial portion of the
        purported illegal gratification for election-related expenditure. It is
        alleged that out of ₹90–100 crores, an amount of approximately
        ₹44.54 crores was utilised for the Aam Aadmi Party’s Goa Assembly
        Election campaign (2022), and that the same was moved from Delhi
        to Goa through hawala/angadiya operators in multiple tranches, using
        different conduits and cash handlers.

  28.                      For this purpose, the supplementary report relies upon
        alleged financial, documentary and digital material, including records
        recovered during Income-tax action in Goa relating to angadiya
        entities, statements of persons connected with such angadiya firms,
        and call-detail records, location data and WhatsApp/digital linkages,
        to suggest coordination in relation to cash transfers. It is alleged that
        cash was routed through various angadiya entities/firms, including
        M/S Asil Corporation and M/S R. Kantilal Finance & Courier
        Services, as well as other Delhi-based channels, and that the recipients
        in Goa included persons stated to be associated with the election
        campaign.

  29.                      It is specifically alleged that A-12 (Director, M/S
        Chariot         Productions    Media   Pvt.   Ltd.),   A-13    and        A-14
        (employees/associates connected with the said media agency), along
        with A-15 (then connected with IANPL) and A-16, acted as conduits

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 16 of 549
        and cash handlers for receiving, transferring and disbursing the alleged
        illegal funds for campaign purposes in Goa Election. The report states
        that cash payments were made to campaign workers, vendors and
        managers in Goa, including towards salaries and logistics, and that the
        aforesaid accused persons were involved in arranging and effecting
        such disbursements in cash.

  30.                      The report further alleges that certain public-relations
        consultants or individuals connected with agencies engaged by the
        Directorate              of   Information   and     Publicity,     GNCTD,          were
        simultaneously utilised for party or campaign work, thereby
        suggesting misuse or diversion of public-funded PR machinery.
        According to the prosecution, such alleged use, when viewed along
        with the purported hawala movement and cash disbursements, forms
        part of the overarching conspiracy said to have arisen from the alleged
        manipulation of the excise policy and the generation of illicit funds.

  31.                      On the basis of the aforesaid allegations and the material
        collected during further investigation, the CBI, through the present
        second        supplementary          charge-sheet    dated       08.07.2023,      seeks
        summoning and trial of the newly arraigned accused i.e. A-12, A-13,
        A-14, A-15 and A-16 for offences alleged to be made out under Section
        120-B IPC and Sections 7, 7A, 8 and 12 of the PC Act, 1988, along
        with allied provisions as set out in the report.

        Third Supplementary Charge-sheet, dated 06.06.2024 (filed on
        07.06.2024)

  32.                      The supplementary charge-sheet alleges that A-17
        emerged as a key conspirator in the criminal conspiracy relating to the
        formulation, manipulation and implementation of the DEP-21/22. It is
        alleged that she demanded, collected and caused payment of ₹100
        crores as upfront money to the Aam Aadmi Party for securing
        favourable provisions and business opportunities for liquor
        businessmen from South India. The prosecution relies primarily on the
        statements of Sh. Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy, (PW-225) his son and
        approver Sh. Raghav Magunta (PW-226), and approver Sh. Dinesh
        Arora (PW-20) to project the demand, payment and utilisation of the
        alleged upfront money.

  33.                      According to the prosecution, A-17 operated through her
        associates A-4, A-5 and A-11, who coordinated with A-3 in furtherance
        of the conspiracy. It is alleged that ₹25 crores out of the upfront money
        was paid in cash by approver Sh. Raghav Magunta, ₹10 crores in
        March 2021 and ₹15 crores in June 2021, through persons identified
        by the said associates, on the demand of A-17, for securing favourable
        provisions in the Excise Policy.

  34.                      The charge-sheet alleges that A-17 was aware of, and
        referred to, the meeting of Sh. Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy with the
        Chief Minister of Delhi (A-18) on 16.03.2021. It is further alleged that
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 18 of 549
        she conveyed that ₹100 crores was to be paid as upfront money for
        favourable policy provisions.

  35.                      It is alleged that her associates were actively involved at
        the policy-formulation stage and influenced draft GoM Reports,
        resulting in the increase of the wholesaler margin from 5% to 12% and
        the raising of turnover eligibility for L-1 wholesale licences. These
        changes are attributed to A-17 through her associates. The prosecution
        relies on WhatsApp chats recovered from A-11, described as her
        Chartered Accountant and close associate, which allegedly contain
        discussions on policy tweaking, appointment of consultants, repeated
        Delhi visits and structuring of business opportunities. It is alleged that
        the provisions discussed in WhatsApp chats dated 06.03.2021 and
        20.03.2021 were incorporated verbatim in the final GoM Report dated
        22.03.2021.

  36.                      The prosecution further alleges that during the period
        14.03.2021 to 17.03.2021, associates of A-17 stayed at Hotel Oberoi,
        New Delhi, used business-centre facilities, meeting rooms,
        photocopying services and hotel vehicles, and that hotel records, bills,
        vehicle GPS data, mobile phone location analysis and Call Detail
        Records establish coordination between her associates and A-3. It is
        alleged that her associates met A-3 on 14.03.2021 and 16.03.2021,
        coinciding with A-3’s visit to the Chief Minister’s residence where A-8
        was also present.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 19 of 549
  37.                      It is alleged that M/S PRI appointed M/S Indospirits as
        wholesaler under the influence of A-3, and that pressure was exerted
        on company officials when they were reluctant. The prosecution
        alleges that A-17 held a 32.5% stake in M/S Indospirits through her
        proxy A-5, while approver Sh. Raghav Magunta was also given a
        32.5% stake through his proxy Prem Rahul Manduri (PW-270) in lieu
        of upfront money, with M/S Indospirit Distribution Ltd. holding the
        remaining share. It is alleged that A-17 arranged funds for A-5’s
        investment of ₹3.4 crores in Indospirits, including funds sourced from
        persons stated to be close to her, one of whom allegedly transferred ₹1
        crore on her directions. It is further alleged that her relative received
        payments from Indospirit Distribution Ltd. without commensurate
        work.

  38.                      The charge-sheet alleges that A-17’s role also surfaced
        in the transfer of alleged ill-gotten money to Goa through hawala
        channels for the AAP Goa Assembly Election. It is alleged that her
        associates A-4 and her PA Ashok Kaushik (PW-195) were involved in
        hawala transfers, that A-15 acted as a conduit for transferring ₹7.10
        crores from Delhi to Goa through hawala channels based on statements
        of a hawala operator, and that A-16 received and distributed the money
        in Goa. It is further alleged that ₹30 crores was routed through
        approver Sh. Dinesh Arora via hawala channels, and that Ashok



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 20 of 549
        Kaushik collected and delivered multiple bags of cash during June–
        August 2021.

  39.                      It is alleged that A-17 used M/S Indospirits as a vehicle
        to recoup the upfront money and that between January 2022 and
        August 2022, approximately ₹29.29 crores was transferred from M/S
        Indospirits to A-5, representing about 61% of the profits of the firm
        despite his limited capital contribution. It is further alleged that funds
        were further routed from M/S Indospirits through A-5 to A-6 and A-11
        and to A-17.

  40.                      The charge-sheet further alleges that A-17 recouped ₹14
        crores through a sham land transaction with M/S Mahira Ventures Pvt.
        Ltd. (Aurobindo Group), controlled by A-23. It is alleged that the land
        value was artificially doubled from ₹14 crores to ₹28 crores, that ₹14
        crores was paid as advance, that the land was never transferred, and
        that WhatsApp chats of A-11 show insistence on inflating value and
        removing interest clauses, indicating that the transaction was only a
        pretext to recoup upfront money.

  41.                      The prosecution also alleges that, apart from the land
        transaction, A-17 received ₹80 lakhs through CSR contributions
        routed via an Aurobindo Group company in favour of her NGO
        Telangana Jagruthi, and that in lieu of these payments, A-23 was
        favoured in award and retention of retail zones. It is further alleged
        that upon withdrawal of the Excise Policy, substantial dues payable by
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 21 of 549
        entities controlled by A-23 to M/S Indospirits remained unpaid, and
        that instructions were conveyed not to remit the same.

  42.                      It is recorded that the confessional statement of approver
        Sh. Raghav Magunta was recorded under Section 164(2) of Cr.P.C.
        and that he was granted tender of pardon under Section 306 of Cr.P.C.
        On the basis of the aforesaid allegations, it is asserted that offences
        punishable under Section 120-B read with Sections 201 and 420 IPC
        and Sections 7, 7A, 8 and 12 of the PC Act, 1988 are disclosed against
        A-17.

        Fourth Supplementary Charge-sheet dated 29.07.2024 (filed on
        30.07.2024)

  43.                      Upon consideration of the allegations as projected in the
        Fourth Supplementary Charge-sheet, the prosecution case, in
        substance, is that on 16.03.2021 Sh. Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy
        (PW-225) met A-18 at the Delhi Secretariat and sought support for
        liquor business in Delhi under the then upcoming Excise Policy 2021–
        22. It is alleged that A-18 assured support, directed him to contact A-17
        stating that she was working with his team on the said policy, and
        further asked him to provide monetary funding to AAP. It is further
        alleged that on 19.03.2021 accused A-17 contacted Sh. Magunta
        Sreenivasulu Reddy and a meeting took place on 20.03.2021 at her
        residence in Hyderabad, where she referred to the meeting dated
        16.03.2021 and demanded ₹50 crores as contribution out of alleged
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 22 of 549
        upfront money of ₹100 crores, to be paid to AAP through accused A-3,
        in lieu of favourable provisions in the upcoming Excise Policy. It is
        then alleged that associates of A-17, namely A-11 and A-4, demanded
        and received ₹25 crores from approver Sh. Raghav Magunta in two
        instalments of ₹10 crores in March 2021 and ₹15 crores in June 2021.
        It is also alleged that A-18 admitted meeting with Sh. Magunta
        Sreenivasulu Reddy, but stated it was in connection with allotment of
        land for a family trust, whereas the Office of the Chief Minister,
        GNCTD allegedly confirmed that no such request exists on record.

  44.                      The prosecution further alleges that on 18.03.2021 Sh.
        C. Arvind, Secretary(PW-71) to A-8, was called to the CM’s Camp
        Office at the residence of A-18 and, in the presence of A-18 and Sh.
        Satyendra Jain, A-8 handed over a printed hard copy of a draft GoM
        report relating to Excise Policy 2021–22 and directed that it be typed,
        indexed and formatted on the computer system at the Dy. CM’s office.
        It is alleged that the typing work was completed on 18.03.2021 and
        19.03.2021 with assistance of Sh. Sunil Singhal, PS to the Dy. CM,
        and the prosecution relies upon statements under Sections 161/164 of
        Cr.P.C. and recovery of the typed draft. It is alleged that the wholesale
        profit margin was enhanced from 5% to 12% in the draft and that the
        draft GoM report dated 19.03.2021 consisted of 36 pages; it is
        highlighted that 36-page photocopies were allegedly taken by South
        Group accused persons from Hotel Oberoi on 16.03.2021. It is then

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 23 of 549
        alleged that the signed GoM Report recommending a 12% wholesale
        margin was placed before the Council of Ministers on 22.03.2021 and
        accepted vide Cabinet Decision No. 2983 dated 22.03.2021 with
        approval of A-18, and the Excise Department was directed to
        implement the GoM Report and prepare the Excise Policy 2021–22. It
        is further alleged that GoM minutes dated 05.04.2021 approved
        modifications including the definition of “related entities” for grant of
        L-1 licences, which, according to the prosecution, was framed to
        favour the South Group and A-7, with M/S Indospirits being used as a
        medium for transfer of ill-gotten money.

  45.                      It is further alleged that based on the GoM report dated
        22.03.2021 and minutes dated 05.04.2021, the Excise Department
        prepared the draft Excise Policy, licence terms, zoning of wards,
        reserve licence fee fixation and amendments to the Delhi Excise Rules,
        2010; that it was approved by A-8 and thereafter by A-18 on
        15.04.2021; and that the Cabinet approved it vide Cabinet Decision
        No. 2994 dated 15.04.2021. It is alleged that on 20.04.2021 A-8 noted
        that Excise is a Transferred Subject and not a Reserved Subject and
        the file was sent to the Hon’ble LG under the proviso to Article
        239AA(4) of the Constitution. It is further alleged that on 19.05.2021
        the LG Secretariat returned the file stating that the matter was
        discussed with the Hon’ble LG, CM and Dy. CM, and A-18 marked it
        to A-8 with the remark “As discussed”, followed by a note dated

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 24 of 549
        20.05.2021 stating that suggestions were given by the LG and
        proposing incorporation of changes, pursuant to which a fresh draft
        Cabinet Note was prepared and Cabinet approval by circulation was
        proposed.

  46.                      According to the prosecution, one of the major changes
        allegedly incorporated on the pretext of LG’s suggestion was reduction
        of turnover eligibility for L-1 licence from ₹250 crores to ₹150 crores
        per year for three consecutive financial years, applicable to turnover
        blocks of 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20, with M/S Indospirit being
        alleged as the principal beneficiary as its turnover allegedly crossed
        ₹150 crores but not ₹250 crores. It is alleged that M/S Indospirit did
        not fulfill the ₹250 crore eligibility prescribed in the GoM report dated
        22.03.2021 and that A-8 falsely recorded that the reduction was on
        LG’s suggestion, and that this reduction was confirmed by A-18,
        thereby manipulating the policy to confer undue favour on M/S
        Indospirit, which is further alleged to be a vehicle for transfer of ill-
        gotten money.

  47.                      It is further alleged that the aforesaid manipulation is
        reflected in unusual haste in movement of the Excise Policy file
        between 20.05.2021 and 21.05.2021 through multiple departments and
        offices, including the LG Secretariat, Finance Department, Excise
        Department, GAD, Council of Ministers by circulation, CM Office
        and Dy. CM Office, and back to the LG Secretariat, despite peak Covid

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 25 of 549
        conditions, and that officials stated that urgent approval by circulation
        was sought on directions attributed to A-8 and conveyed through Sh.
        Bibhav Kumar, PS to A-18, stating that the Chief Minister desired
        urgent approval.

  48.                      The prosecution further alleges that the said haste
        coincided with the presence of South Group accused persons in Delhi,
        namely A-23, A-4, A-5 and A-11, who allegedly came to Delhi on
        20.05.2021, stayed at Hotel Oberoi till 21.05.2021, and met A-3 along
        with co-accused A-9, A-10 and approver Dinesh Arora (PW-20) at
        Gauri Apartment near Claridges on 21.05.2021, where they allegedly
        conspired to capture 7–10 retail zones with the help of A-3. Reliance
        is placed on the statement of approver Dinesh Arora under Section 164
        of CrPC, hotel records and mobile location data, and it is further
        alleged that the guest house was booked by Sh. Bibhav Kumar for
        A-19.

  49.                      The prosecution alleges that proceeds of the alleged
        Excise Policy conspiracy were utilised for AAP’s Goa Assembly
        Election campaign. It is alleged that between 21.06.2021 and
        10.01.2022 cash totalling ₹44,54,22,500 was received in Goa by A-16,
        Rajiv Ashok Mondkar and A-14 through hawala/angadiya channels
        including M/S R. Kantilal Finance and Courier Service; that Rajiv
        Ashok Mondkar confirmed under Section 164 of Cr.P.C. that he acted
        on instructions of A-16 and handed over cash to him; and that M/S

        Chariot Productions Media Pvt. Ltd. was engaged by AAP for outdoor
        campaign work, with reliance placed on records seized during an
        Income Tax raid dated 29.01.2022. It is further alleged that angadiya
        records connect the origin of the plan to a meeting at Hotel ITC
        Kohinoor, Hyderabad on 19.06.2021 involving A-3, A-4 and approver
        Dinesh Arora, pursuant to which cash was sent from Delhi to Goa from
        21.06.2021 onwards. It is alleged that ₹11.93 crores was delivered in
        Goa through M/S Asil Corporation, whose owner stated that the cash
        was provided by A-12 and A-13 of M/S Chariot; that ₹7,10,92,500
        was delivered to A-16 between 04.01.2022 and 10.01.2022 through
        M/S K.S. Enterprises on instructions of Devang Solanki, who, on the
        basis of his statement and WhatsApp chats, allegedly received cash
        from A-15 at Delhi; and that the remaining amount was routed through
        Delhi-based angadiyas and persons linked to A-21, supported by
        CDRs.

  50.                      It is further alleged that the aforesaid ₹44.54 crores,
        alleged to be part of upfront money of ₹90-100 crores, was used for
        campaign and election-related expenses of AAP in Goa, and that A-18,
        along with accused A-19 (Goa Prabhari), played a role in transfer and
        utilisation of such funds, with candidates being assured that election
        expenses would be borne by the party, and with reliance on statements
        of candidates/witnesses asserting that expenses were met in cash.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 27 of 549
  51.                      It is stated that digital material extracted from the Apple
        iPhone of A-21 disclosed WhatsApp chats with a mobile number
        stated to be used by A-18, saved as “HCMAK/HCM AK”, and that
        multiple numbers attributed to A-18, as well as numbers of A-8 and
        other AAP functionaries, were found saved in A-21’s contact list. It is
        alleged that images of WhatsApp chats with A-18 and images of 11
        GC notes of ₹10 denomination were retrieved from the phone, and that
        a screenshot containing the serial number of a ₹10 note allegedly
        received from A-16’s phone was also found therein. On this basis, it is
        alleged that A-21 was acting on behalf of A-18 and AAP as a conduit
        for transfer of alleged ill-gotten money to Goa through hawala
        channels, which was utilised by A-16 for cash payments to vendors,
        assembly managers, booth in-charges and volunteers engaged during
        the Goa elections. It is further alleged that A-21, in association with
        A-22, acted as conduit for transfer of ₹25.50 crores to Goa, stated to
        have been utilised for election-related expenditure through A-19 and
        A-16, and that A-21 was also associated with A-17 (through her PA
        Ashok Kaushik) and A-4.

  52.                      The prosecution further alleges that during investigation
        the role of A-20, owner of M/S Buddy Retails Pvt. Ltd., surfaced in
        conspiracy with A-3 and approver Dinesh Arora (PW-20) to extract
        6% commission out of the 12% wholesale margin from M/S Mahadev
        Liquors, and upon refusal, to pressurise Ms. Jasdeep Kaur Chadha

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 28 of 549
        (PW-298) by allegedly using influence in Punjab to get her
        distilleries/breweries closed through Punjab Excise officials,
        compelling surrender of wholesale business of four manufacturers and
        thereafter surrender of the wholesale licence of M/S Mahadev Liquors.
        It is alleged that she was directed to donate ₹51 lakhs to the Chief
        Minister’s Relief Fund, Punjab, through cheque and send proof, and
        that reopening of factories followed the donation and compounding of
        penalty. The prosecution alleges corroboration by WhatsApp chats
        recovered from Ms. Jasdeep Kaur Chadha’s phone with Sh. Puneet
        Dewan (PW-299) and Punjab Excise officials showing repeated
        requests for reopening, exchange of cheque photographs, and timing
        of surrender communications on 25.05.2022.

  53.                      It is further alleged that approver Dinesh Arora, in
        statements recorded under Sections 164 and 306 of Cr.P.C., stated that
        the factory closures were used to create pressure when 6% commission
        was denied, and that after M/S Mahadev Liquors quit, he was directed
        to identify replacement parties for the wholesale business for easier
        extraction of 6%, resulting in selection of M/S Dewan Spirits and M/S
        Shiv Associates, with a proposal of 50% partnership. The prosecution
        further relies on statements of Sh. Sanjit Padhi under Sections 161 and
        164 of Cr.P.C. to allege that he was approached in mid-May 2022 for
        shifting of wholesale business of named manufacturers to the said
        entities on directions of “party high command”, which he presumed to

        mean senior AAP leaders including A-18 and A-8, and on statements
        of Sh. Prabhjot Singh (PW-304) of M/S Shiv Associates to allege that
        wholesalership was assured in consideration of transfer of 50%
        shareholding and payment of 6% out of the 12% margin, with alleged
        corroboration from representatives of manufacturers and distributors.
        It is further alleged that sanction to investigate certain Punjab Excise
        officials under Section 17-A of the PC Act, 1988 was sought but denied
        by the Government of Punjab.

  54.                      It is alleged that A-23 paid ₹14 crores to A-17 towards
        recoupment of alleged upfront money in the guise of a sham land
        transaction, through an Agreement of Sale dated 12.07.2021 executed
        with M/S Mahira Ventures Pvt. Ltd. for 15 acres of agricultural land
        in Mahaboob Nagar District, Telangana, reflecting total consideration
        of ₹28 crores and advance of ₹14 crores paid in two installments of
        ₹7 crores each, though the land was never transferred or registered. It
        is further alleged that investigation revealed discrepancies in
        ownership of certain survey numbers and that prevailing market rates
        were substantially lower than the consideration shown, and hence the
        agreement was a façade for exchange of bribe money; the first
        installment of ₹7 crores paid on 15.07.2021 is alleged to have been
        traced to M/S Trident Chemphar Ltd. of the Aurobindo Group. It is
        further alleged that an additional ₹80 lakhs was paid to the NGO



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 30 of 549
        Telangana Jagruthi through an Aurobindo Group company under CSR
        in June 2021 through cheques of ₹21 lakhs and ₹59 lakhs.

  55.                      According to the prosecution, in lieu of these payments,
        A-23 was favoured with allotment of five retail zones under the
        DEP-21/22, despite policy provisions restricting allocation beyond
        two retail zones per entity, and that he participated in bidding for six
        retail zones through three related entities. It is further alleged that upon
        withdrawal of the Excise Policy on 31.08.2022 an outstanding of about
        ₹60 crores was payable on five retail zones controlled by him to M/S
        Indospirits associated with A-7 and A-5, and that ₹46,88,78,307/-
        remained unpaid, with A-23 being favoured by being allowed not to
        clear the dues. It is also alleged that A-23 played a role in securing
        distributorship of M/S PRI for M/S Indospirits, and that A-3
        intervened to stop BSPL’s appointment and influenced officials of M/S
        PRI, with meetings including at Taj Mahal Hotel on 20.09.2021
        involving various persons being cited as reflecting a plan to steer
        distributorship towards M/S Indospirits through undue influence and
        support.

  56.                      It is stated that certain Excise Department officials were
        found negligent in handling cartelisation complaints but no evidence
        surfaced of their involvement in the alleged conspiracy or receipt of
        quid pro quo, and therefore they were not prosecuted; similarly, though
        Sh. Sunny Marwah/M/S Mahadev Liquors, Sh. Manoj Rai and M/S

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 31 of 549
        Buddy Retails Pvt. Ltd. were named in the FIR, it is alleged that no
        sufficient evidence was found to establish their involvement and hence
        they were not prosecuted. On the basis of the aforesaid allegations, the
        prosecution claims that offences punishable under Section 120-B read
        with Sections 201 and 420 IPC and Sections 7, 7A, 8 and 12 of the PC
        Act, 1988 are made out against A-18, A-19, A-20, A-21, A-22 and
        A-23; it is further stated that sanction for prosecution under Section 19
        of the PC Act, 1988 has been sought in respect of A-18 and is awaited,
        whereas sanction is stated not to be required in respect of A- 19, as the
        acts attributed are alleged not to be connected with official duty.

        (A) POSITION IN LAW---PRINCIPLES FOR APPRECIATING
        PROSECUTION MATERIAL AT THE STAGE OF CHARGE:

        1. Stage of charge: limited scrutiny, but real application of mind

  57.                      At the stage of consideration of charge, the Court is not
        required to undertake a detailed evaluation of evidence or to test the
        probative value of the material as at trial. The Court proceeds on the
        premise that the prosecution material, as presented, is prima facie true
        and uncontroverted. Cross-examination and defence rebuttal are not
        part of this stage. At the same time, the law is equally clear that the
        Court is not to act merely as a post office or a mouthpiece of the
        prosecution. The Court must apply its judicial mind to the record to
        assess whether the material, taken at face value, discloses the essential


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 32 of 549
        ingredients of the alleged offence and raises grave suspicion, as
        distinct from a mere suspicion.

  58.                      The governing principles have been authoritatively
        summarised by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Sajjan Kumar v. Bureau
        of Investigation (2010) 9 SCC 368. The relevant extract is reproduced
        for ready reference:

               “….21. On consideration of the authorities about the scope of
               Sections 227 and 228 of the Code, the following principles
               emerge:
               (i) The Judge while considering the question of framing the
               charges under Section 227 CrPC has the undoubted power to
               sift and weigh the evidence for the limited purpose of finding
               out whether or not a prima facie case against the accused has
               been made out. The test to determine prima facie case would
               depend upon the facts of each case.
               (ii) Where the materials placed before the court disclose grave
               suspicion against the accused which has not been properly
               explained, the court will be fully justified in framing a charge
               and proceeding with the trial.
               (iii) The court cannot act merely as a post office or a
               mouthpiece of the prosecution but has to consider the broad
               probabilities of the case, the total effect of the evidence and the
               documents produced before the court, any basic infirmities,
               etc. However, at this stage, there cannot be a roving enquiry
               into the pros and cons of the matter and weigh the evidence as
               if he was conducting a trial.
               (iv) If on the basis of the material on record, the court could
               form an opinion that the accused might have committed
               offence, it can frame the charge, though for conviction the
               conclusion is required to be proved beyond reasonable doubt
               that the accused has committed the offence.
               (v) At the time of framing of the charges, the probative value
               of the material on record cannot be gone into but before

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                             Page no. 33 of 549
               framing a charge the court must apply its judicial mind on the
               material placed on record and must be satisfied that the
               commission of offence by the accused was possible.
               (vi) At the stage of Sections 227 and 228, the court is required
               to evaluate the material and documents on record with a view
               to find out if the facts emerging therefrom taken at their face
               value disclose the existence of all the ingredients constituting
               the alleged offence. For this limited purpose, sift the evidence
               as it cannot be expected even at that initial stage to accept all
               that the prosecution states as gospel truth even if it is opposed
               to common sense or the broad probabilities of the case.
               (vii) If two views are possible and one of them gives rise to
               suspicion only, as distinguished from grave suspicion, the trial
               Judge will be empowered to discharge the accused and at this
               stage, he is not to see whether the trial will end in conviction or
               acquittal….”.
  59.                      In essence, the Court must examine whether the
        prosecution material, if taken at face value and accepted in its entirety,
        discloses a prima facie case giving rise to grave suspicion. If such
        grave suspicion exists, that suffices for framing of charge. Conversely,
        if the material discloses only a mere suspicion and not grave suspicion,
        discharge follows. At this stage, the Court is required to see whether
        the material, if uncontroverted, discloses the essential ingredients of
        the alleged offences.

        2. Strong suspicion: must be based on material capable of becoming
        evidence

  60.                      Recently, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Tuhin Kumar
        Bishwas @ Bumba v. State of West Bengal, 2025 SCC OnLine SC
        2604 reiterated that, absent a strong suspicion founded on material

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                             Page no. 34 of 549
        capable of becoming evidence, an accused can be discharged, while
        emphasising that the Court must outline and apply the settled
        principles governing discharge/charge.

  61.                      The decision, after referring to Ram Prakash Chadha v.
        State of UP (2024) 10 SCC 651 and earlier authorities including Stree
        Atyachar Virodhi Parishad v. Dilip Nathumal Chordia (1989) 1 SCC
        715, P. Vijayan v. State of Kerala (2010) 2 SCC 398, and Union of
        India v. Prafulla Kumar Samal (1979) 3 SCC 4, reiterates that the
        “ground” under Section 227 of CrPC is not a ground for conviction
        but a ground for putting the accused on trial, and that where two views
        are possible and one gives rise only to suspicion and not grave
        suspicion, the Court is empowered to discharge.

  62.                      The said judgment also cites with approval M.E.
        Shivalingamurthy v. CBI, Bengaluru (2020) 2 SCC 768, which
        summarises that:

        (i) if two views are possible and one gives rise to suspicion only, as
        distinguished from grave suspicion, discharge is justified;
        (ii) the Court is not a mere post office;
        (iii) the Court sifts the statements/documents produced by the
        prosecution to see if there is sufficient ground to proceed;
        (iv) if the evidence proposed, even if fully accepted, cannot show
        commission of offence, there is no sufficient ground for trial; and
        (v) there must exist some material for entertaining a strong suspicion
        which can form the basis for drawing up a charge.


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 35 of 549
  63.                      Thus, while the threshold at this stage is not proof
        beyond reasonable doubt, the suspicion required must still be strong
        and grounded in material, and not in conjecture or narrative
        convenience.

        4. Documentary material: file notings and policy deliberations

  64.                      A substantial part of prosecutions arising out of policy
        decisions centres on internal file notings, administrative observations,
        and governmental deliberations. Such notings, by their nature, record
        internal discussions and divergent views. They do not, without more,
        constitute incriminating material, nor do they indicate dishonest
        intention or an overt criminal act.

  65.                      The mere fact that a policy may not have yielded the
        expected results cannot, in the absence of substantive evidence, be
        elevated to criminal culpability. Criminal law cannot be invoked to
        revisit or punish administrative discretion, particularly when the
        record shows that the actions in question were confined to policy
        formulation and implementation undertaken in the ordinary course of
        governance.

  66.                      While a detailed evaluation of evidence is impermissible
        at the stage of charge, it is equally true that where the case is
        predominantly documentary and rests substantially on internal notings


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 36 of 549
        and policy papers, the Court must undertake the limited scrutiny
        mandated by law to ensure that criminal process is not employed as a
        vehicle to challenge executive decisions under the guise of
        prosecution. The Court is therefore required to see whether the
        documents relied upon, taken at face value, disclose the ingredients of
        the alleged offences, and whether there exists independent material
        pointing to mens rea, quid pro quo, or abuse of office, beyond mere
        administrative processing.

        5. Policy decisions: limits of criminal prosecution

  67.                      In a developing economy, policy changes are routine and
        often necessary for increasing revenue, improving regulatory
        frameworks, or advancing public welfare objectives. Policies
        concerning licensing, taxation, distribution models, privatisation, or
        private participation inherently involve the exercise of executive
        discretion. The mere circumstance that a particular policy does not
        yield the expected outcomes, or that private participants lawfully earn
        profits under such policy, cannot, without more, justify criminal
        prosecution.

  68.                      It is now well settled that economic and administrative
        decisions taken in good faith cannot be criminalised in the absence of
        clear prima facie material disclosing mala fides, quid pro quo, or abuse
        of office. Accordingly, while appreciating prosecution material at the
        stage of charge in policy-related matters, the Court must maintain a
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 37 of 549
        clear distinction between an allegation which is essentially a critique
        of policy wisdom or an administrative lapse, and an allegation
        supported by material indicating corruption or conspiracy.

  69.                      To assess the limits of criminal liability in matters
        involving formulation of government policy, the Court must also bear
        in mind the internal architecture of governmental decision-making,
        which is regulated by the Transaction of Business Rules, the
        Allocation Rules, and the Central Secretariat Manual of Office
        Procedure. These instruments structure how proposals are initiated,
        how files move, how consultations are undertaken, and how decisions
        are recorded, thereby ensuring orderly governance, institutional
        discipline, and traceability of decision-making.

  70.                      The Transaction of Business of the Government of
        National Capital Territory of Delhi Rules, 1993 (ToBDR), prescribe
        the manner in which the business of the Government is to be transacted
        and identify matters requiring consideration at different institutional
        levels. This framework incorporates mandatory consultations,
        institutional checks, identification of matters requiring prior approval
        or submission, and structured movement of files through a prescribed
        hierarchy. These rules are intended to ensure orderly governance and
        collective responsibility. They are not penal provisions. A deviation
        from procedure may, at the highest, amount to an administrative lapse,



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 38 of 549
        but cannot, by itself, be treated as criminal misconduct unless
        accompanied by prima facie material indicating dishonest intent.

  71.                      Similarly, the Business of Delhi (Allocation) Rules,
        1993, distribute subjects across departments and identify the
        department competent to initiate and process a policy, as well as the
        authority responsible for approval. Where a policy is framed and
        processed by the competent department in accordance with these
        Rules, its initiation cannot be criminalised merely because it reflects a
        new, reform-oriented, or revenue-driven approach.

  72.                      The Central Secretariat Manual of Office Procedure
        (CSMOP) governs file management and the mechanics of
        administration, including recording of notings, drafting of proposals,
        inter-departmental consultations, and preservation of records. Its
        purpose is to ensure transparency, uniformity, and traceability in
        governmental functioning. Non-compliance with administrative
        procedure, in the absence of material showing corrupt intent, does not
        by itself constitute a criminal offence.

  73.                      From the standpoint of criminal liability, policy-
        formulation cases broadly fall into three categories. The first category
        relates to alleged violations of statutory rules or mandatory procedure.
        Criminal liability may arise only where the prosecution is able to
        prima facie demonstrate deliberate and conscious bypassing of
        mandatory procedural safeguards, actions taken by a department
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                     Page no. 39 of 549
        outside its competence, or suppression or manipulation of material
        notings or consultations. Even in such cases, a procedural deviation
        alone is insufficient; there must be material indicating dishonest
        intention.

  74.                      The second category concerns cases of formal procedural
        compliance masking mala fide intent. There may be situations where
        the file movement appears regular, the competent department acts
        within its jurisdiction, and the prescribed procedural route is
        ostensibly followed. However, if the substance of the policy, viewed
        in light of the material placed on record, prima facie demonstrates that
        it was consciously designed to confer undue advantage upon specific
        private parties, criminal prosecution may be justified, provided such
        intent is supported by cogent and independent material, and not merely
        inferred from the outcome of the policy.

  75.                      The third and most common category concerns bona fide
        policy decisions unaccompanied by evidence of corruption. This is
        where the prescribed procedure is followed, the competent department
        initiates and processes the proposal, file movement is transparent, and
        there is no prima facie indication of quid pro quo, personal benefit, or
        collusion. In such cases, the policy decision is protected as a bona fide
        exercise of administrative discretion. The wisdom, efficacy, or
        eventual success or failure of a policy is not a matter for criminal
        adjudication. Administrative errors or incorrect judgments, without

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 40 of 549
        material        suggesting    corrupt   intent,   cannot   attract    criminal
        prosecution.

  76.                      Certain broader guardrails must also inform the Court’s
        approach in policy-related prosecutions. Policy formulation is
        inherently experimental; a policy may succeed or fail, and failure by
        itself is not evidence of criminality. Profit earned by private
        participants is not illegal per se; it becomes suspect only when it is
        shown to flow from collusion, undue favour, or manipulation of
        process. The Transaction of Business Rules, Allocation Rules, and the
        Central Secretariat Manual of Office Procedure are mechanisms of
        accountability and institutional discipline; their purpose is to structure
        decision-making, not to convert administrative infractions into
        criminal misconduct. Above all, criminal liability continues to require
        mens rea. Excessive criminalisation of policy decisions risks
        paralysing governance, as decision-makers may be deterred from
        taking bona fide decisions in public interest.

                                                               (emphasis supplied)

  77.                      Accordingly, where a policy is initiated by the
        department competent under the Allocation Rules, processed through
        the structured mechanism mandated by the Transaction of Business
        Rules, and reflects transparent file movement in accordance with the
        Central Secretariat Manual of Office Procedure, its framers, whether
        bureaucratic or political, cannot be subjected to criminal prosecution
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 41 of 549
        merely because the policy did not yield the expected results or because
        private entities lawfully earned profit under it. Criminal prosecution is
        justified only where the material discloses either a conscious and
        deliberate violation of mandatory procedure coupled with dishonest
        intent, or dishonest or collusive intent camouflaged behind formal
        procedural compliance. In the absence of these elements, the domain
        of policy-making remains a matter of governance, not criminal
        liability.

        6.     Bribe / upfront / kickback allegations: what must prima facie
        appear

  78.                      Where the prosecution alleges that file movement and
        policy decision-making were influenced by bribes, upfront payments,
        or kickbacks, the Court must examine whether the prosecution
        material, even if accepted as true at this stage, discloses:

        (i) a prima facie demand/arrangement/payment and its linkage to an
        official act;
        (ii) a discernible quid pro quo;
        (iii) a nexus between the alleged gratification and the policy clauses or
        file outcomes; and
        (iv) material connecting the accused to such influence, beyond
        assumptions arising from the existence of file notings or the eventual
        policy outcome.
  79.                      In such cases, file movement and policy documentation
        may provide context, but cannot substitute the requirement of prima
        facie material indicating corrupt intent. Absent such linkage, a

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 42 of 549
        prosecution founded largely on administrative record risks converting
        governance review into criminal adjudication.

        7.    Conspiracy in policy/economic cases: agreement is the core

  80.                      The Court is conscious that criminal conspiracy is rarely
        proved by direct evidence and may be inferred from surrounding
        circumstances. However, the difficulty in proving conspiracy does not
        dilute the threshold even at this stage. The Court must assess whether
        the record discloses grave suspicion of a conscious agreement to
        commit an illegal act or to achieve a lawful object by illegal means,
        and not merely conjecture or suspicion.

  81.                      This   scrutiny   assumes   particular   importance          in
        prosecutions arising from policy formulation or regulatory reform.
        Policy outcomes often result from multi-tier institutional processes
        involving consultations, departmental inputs, Cabinet-level decisions,
        and statutory/constitutional oversight. Criminal law cannot be used to
        retrospectively criminalise policy choices or market consequences
        unless the prosecution is able to prima facie demonstrate a meeting of
        minds to subvert the policy framework for an unlawful purpose.

  82.                      The gravamen of Section 120-B IPC lies in the
        agreement itself. Economic gain, uneven commercial outcomes, or
        subsequent profitability cannot, by themselves, constitute conspiracy.
        What must prima facie emerge is consensus ad idem: who agreed with


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 43 of 549
        whom, what illegal act or illegal means was agreed upon, when the
        agreement arose, and how subsequent acts were in furtherance of that
        agreement. Where the narrative rests on fragmented circumstances and
        invites the Court to “join the dots” by presumption, the legal threshold
        is not met.

  83.                       Upon considering the material placed on record for the
        limited purpose of framing of charge, it is often seen that the
        prosecution seeks to project its case as a coherent and well-knitted
        narrative. While it may superficially appear so, a closer examination
        within the contours permitted at this stage may reveal that facts have
        been arranged to support a predetermined conclusion. The Court is
        required to guard against being carried by presentation alone, and must
        instead test whether the record discloses a consistent and legally
        sustainable sequence suggestive of the commission of an offence.
        Reliance is placed upon the judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in
        case       titled        as   Karnataka   vs.   L.   Muniswamy     and        Ors.
        MANU/SC/0143/1977.

  84.                       Where the prosecution relies on circumstantial evidence,
        the alleged chain of circumstances must, even at this preliminary stage,
        appear prima facie continuous and legally coherent. When such
        material is tested against settled principles, the chain cannot be
        incomplete, fragile, or dependent upon conjectural inferences. Several



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 44 of 549
        links cannot rest on speculative extrapolations rather than established
        facts.

  85.                      Where     the     prosecution   substantially     relies        on
        circumstantial           evidence,    the   settled   principles      governing
        circumstantial proof squarely applies. The law mandates that:

        (i) the circumstances relied upon must be fully established;
        (ii) they must be consistent only with the guilt of the accused;
        (iii) they must exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence; and
        (iv) the chain must be so complete as to leave no reasonable ground
        for a conclusion consistent with innocence.
  86.                      If the record falls significantly short and does not even
        give rise to credible suspicion, the criminal process cannot be
        permitted to continue merely to see whether something may emerge at
        trial. Meetings, communications, and tower-location indicators, often
        relied upon in such cases, are frequently neutral in policy contexts.
        Meetings between stakeholders and officials may be consistent with
        consultation and governance. Tower-location/CDR indicators, even
        when admissible, indicate approximate presence and do not establish
        the purpose or content of interaction. They cannot be used as
        substitutes for evidence of agreement, nor can they be employed to
        bridge substantive gaps in the alleged conspiratorial chain.

  87.                      The proposition that conspiracies are “hatched in
        secrecy” cannot be stretched to justify dilution of standards in policy-


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                             Page no. 45 of 549
        related prosecutions where the process is typically documented and
        traceable. To allege a secret unlawful agreement within such a
        framework, the prosecution must prima facie show how institutional
        procedure was subverted pursuant to a prior meeting of minds.
        Otherwise, secrecy remains a rhetorical explanation rather than a
        legally sustainable inference.

  88.                      Tested on this anvil, the prosecution material, at the
        threshold stage, must prima facie disclose:

        (i) the identity of the alleged conspirators inter se, namely, who agreed
        with whom;
        (ii) the content of the alleged agreement, namely, what precise illegal
        act or illegal means was agreed upon;
        (iii) the temporal and causal linkage, namely, when such agreement
        was formed and how subsequent acts were in furtherance thereof;
        and
        (iv) the exclusion of innocent hypotheses, namely, how the
        circumstances relied upon are incompatible with lawful, neutral, or
        institutional explanations.
  89.                      In the absence of these foundational elements, the
        allegation of conspiracy remains indeterminate and amorphous,
        lacking the legal specificity required even at the threshold stage.

        8. Scrutiny of statements and documents

  90.                      Ultimately, at the stage of charge, the Court’s role is
        neither to conduct a trial nor to accept the prosecution narrative as


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 46 of 549
        gospel truth. Justice at this stage is achieved by a disciplined scrutiny
        of the statements and documents relied upon by the prosecution, to see
        whether, if accepted as they stand, they disclose the ingredients of the
        alleged offences and raise grave suspicion warranting trial.

  91.                      Where the record consists predominantly of file notings,
        administrative           observations,   policy   papers,   and     subsequent
        commercial outcomes, with allegations of bribe, upfront money,
        kickbacks, and conspiracy superimposed upon such material, the
        Court needs to be careful to identify whether the prosecution has
        placed independent incriminating material linking the accused to
        corrupt intent and unlawful agreement, as distinct from a critique of
        governance or a disagreement with policy choices. If the material
        discloses only a possible suspicion, and not grave suspicion, the law
        empowers the Court to discharge; if it discloses grave suspicion
        grounded in material capable of becoming evidence, charge may
        follow.

        (B) Nature of Witness Statements and the Manner of Their
        Appreciation at the Stage of Charge

  92.                      At the stage of consideration of charge, the Court is
        required to examine whether the prosecution material, if taken at its
        face value, discloses prima facie suspicion against the accused as
        would justify putting them to trial. For this limited purpose, the Court
        must first identify the nature of the statements relied upon, because the
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                            Page no. 47 of 549
        evidentiary character of each category is not identical, and the degree
        of reliance that can be placed at this stage depends upon that
        character.

  93.                      On a careful assessment of the record, it is apparent that
        the prosecution material broadly comprises three types of statements,
        each requiring separate appreciation:

                           First, there are statements of general witnesses, i.e.,
        witnesses who claim awareness of facts relevant to the case but who
        are not themselves participants in the alleged offence. Their statements
        are to be examined in the ordinary course as prosecution evidence,
        keeping in view the limitations of scrutiny at this stage.

                           Second, there are statements of pardoned accused
        persons, commonly referred to as approver statement. Such statement,
        as emerging from the record, appears in three sub-forms:
        (i) Pre pardon confessional statement-the confessional statement
        recorded under Section 164 of Cr.P.C., wherein the witness, before the
        Judicial Magistrate, discloses his own involvement and also implicates
        co-accused; (ii) Post pardon confessional statement-the confessional
        statement recorded under section 306 (4) of Cr.P.C. during
        investigation and after grant of pardon and (iii) other statements of
        similar narrative recorded before or after the grant of pardon under
        Section 161 of Cr.P.C. during investigation.


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 48 of 549
                           Third, there are statements of those witnesses who, while
        not shown as accused and not granted pardon, nevertheless make
        statements which are incriminating both to themselves and to the
        accused persons. Such witnesses occupy a distinct position, because
        they are not treated by the prosecution as accused, yet their versions
        disclose self-incriminating participation, and their statement must
        therefore be appreciated with due caution.

  94.                      The Court finds it necessary to analyse the evidentiary
        worth of the above categories in order to answer the central question:
        whether the prosecution has been able to cross the threshold of prima
        facie case for the purpose of framing of charge.

        1. Statement of the Approver

        (a) Confession Recorded Under Section 306 (4) of Cr.P.C. in terms of
        Section 164 of Cr.P.C. of an accused who has been granted pardon

  95.                      At the stage of consideration of charge, where the
        prosecution places predominant reliance upon the statement of
        approvers, the Court is required to assess such material within a clearly
        settled statutory and jurisprudential framework. The issue is not
        confined to admissibility alone, but extends to the sufficiency and
        probative worth of such statement at the threshold stage. The central
        enquiry, therefore, is how the evidence of an approver is to be
        evaluated at the stage of framing of charge, and whether such


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 49 of 549
        statement, standing by itself, is capable of sustaining the continuation
        of criminal proceedings against an accused. The answer necessarily
        lies in a correct appreciation of the concept of an accomplice or
        particeps criminis, read alongside the provisions of the Indian
        Evidence Act, 1872, the Cr.P.C., 1973, and the Delhi High Court Rules
        and Orders.

  96.                      The expression “accomplice” or particeps criminis is a
        well-recognised concept in criminal jurisprudence and comprehends
        all persons who consciously participate in the commission of an
        offence, irrespective of the degree, nature, or mode of such
        participation. Participation may take the form of principal offending,
        abetment, conspiracy, or assistance before or after the fact. Though the
        Indian Evidence Act does not define the term “accomplice”, judicial
        interpretation has consistently held that any person knowingly and
        voluntarily associated with the commission of the offence falls within
        its sweep.

  97.                      Where such persons are prosecuted together, they
        assume the procedural status of co-accused and may be tried jointly in
        terms of Section 223 of the Cr.P.C, 1973. This procedural description,
        however, does not dilute or alter the substantive character of their
        involvement. In essence and in law, they continue to remain
        accomplices whose association with the crime is either admitted or
        alleged.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 50 of 549
  98.                      A material procedural shift occurs when one such co-
        accused is tendered pardon under Section 306 of Cr.P.C. Upon
        acceptance of pardon and subject to the statutory obligation of making
        a full and true disclosure, such person ceases to be an accused for the
        purposes of trial and is examined as a prosecution witness, commonly
        described as an approver or government approver. From that stage
        onwards, he is removed from the array of accused persons and enjoys
        immunity from prosecution so long as the pardon remains operative.

  99.            This procedural transformation, however, does not efface or
        neutralise the substantive character of the approver as an accomplice.
        The grant of pardon itself proceeds on the admitted participation of the
        approver in the offence. The change is confined to his position in the
        trial process and does not elevate his statement to that of an
        independent or untainted witness. It is well settled that an approver is
        merely an accomplice who has been granted conditional immunity,
        and       his      statement   must,   therefore,   be     approached         with
        circumspection.

                                                                 (emphasis supplied)

  100.                     Judicial exposition has also recognised that participation
        in crime may occur in different forms. An accomplice broadly
        classified as principals in the first degree, principals in the second
        degree, accessories before the fact, and accessories after the fact, each
        category reflecting a distinct mode of conscious association with the
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 51 of 549
       criminal act. This classification only reinforces the breadth of the
       concept and the reason why accomplice evidence has traditionally
       been viewed with caution.

  101.                     Against this settled legal backdrop, the Court, at the
       stage of framing of charge, is required to examine whether the material
       placed on record discloses a prima facie case giving rise to grave
       suspicion against the accused. While the standard at this stage is not
       that of proof beyond reasonable doubt, it is equally settled that the
       Court is not to function as a mere post office for the prosecution. A
       real, though limited, application of judicial mind is required to
       determine whether the material rises above conjecture or mere
       suspicion.

  102.                     Where the prosecution case rests substantially, or indeed
       exclusively, on the statement of an approver, this duty of scrutiny
       assumes greater significance. An approver is a witness who has
       admittedly bargained for pardon and immunity from prosecution. His
       statement is, therefore, inherently self-interested. If the incriminating
       material consists solely of the uncorroborated statement of such a
       witness, it cannot ordinarily be regarded as sufficient to justify the
       framing of charge. To hold otherwise would be to accept that a single
       statement of a tainted witness, motivated by the prospect of immunity,
       is adequate to subject an accused to the rigours of a full criminal
       trial.

  103.                     The position in law at this stage is well settled. If two
       views are reasonably possible on the material before the Court, and the
       view favourable to the accused gives rise only to suspicion and not to
       grave suspicion, the accused is entitled to discharge. An
       uncorroborated approver’s statement, unsupported by independent
       material on material particulars, ordinarily remains within the realm
       of mere suspicion. It assumes the character of grave suspicion only
       when reinforced by credible, independent evidence tending to connect
       the accused with the offence.

                                                              (emphasis supplied)

  104.                     The Supreme Court, in Ravinder Singh v. State of
       Haryana (1975) 3 SCC 742, characterised an approver as “a most
       unworthy friend, if at all”, and emphasised that a witness who has
       bargained for immunity must affirmatively establish his credibility.
       The Court laid down a two-fold test for appreciation of approver
       evidence: first, the approver’s narrative must implicate himself and
       present a natural, coherent, and probable account of events; secondly,
       once this threshold is crossed, his statement insofar as it implicates
       others must inspire reasonable assurance of guilt. While recognising
       that, in rare cases, a conviction may rest on uncorroborated approver
       statement if it is found wholly reliable, the ordinary and salutary rule


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 53 of 549
       remains that such statement must be corroborated in material
       particulars.

  105.                     This approach reflects long-standing judicial experience.
       Accomplice evidence has consistently been regarded as inherently
       unsafe. An accomplice is a particeps criminis, a witness tainted by his
       own involvement in the offence and burdened by an ongoing incentive
       to minimise his own role, exaggerate the role of others, or mould his
       narrative to suit the prosecution in the hope of securing or retaining
       the benefit of pardon. This structural unreliability is grounded in the
       practical realities of criminal prosecution.

  106.                     Illustration (b) to Section 114 of the Indian Evidence Act
       embodies this accumulated judicial wisdom by recognising that an
       accomplice is ordinarily unworthy of credit unless corroborated in
       material particulars. Though Section 133 of the Evidence Act declares
       that a conviction founded on uncorroborated accomplice statement is
       not illegal, Illustration (b) to Section 114 governs the manner in which
       such evidence is to be appreciated. The Supreme Court, in Bhiva
       Doulu Patil v. State of Maharashtra (AIR 1963 SC 599), reconciled
       these provisions by holding that while Section 133 lays down a rule of
       law, Section 114(b) embodies a rule of prudence which courts are
       bound to observe in practice. Corroboration, therefore, is not a matter
       of indulgence but a practical necessity.

                                                               (emphasis supplied)

  107.                     It is equally well settled that, in the absence of
       independently established foundational facts, the statement of an
       approver cannot, by its own force, assume the status of legally
       sustainable incriminating material. An approver’s statement is not
       substantive evidence in the ordinary sense; it is evidence of a tainted
       character, received on the premise that the prosecution has first laid a
       factual foundation demonstrating the existence of the alleged crime.
       Where such foundational facts are absent, the approver’s statement
       does not fill the evidentiary vacuum; it merely exposes it.

                                                             (emphasis supplied)

  108.                     This principle assumes particular importance in complex
       economic or policy-related prosecutions involving multiple alleged
       components, such as manipulation of policy, payment of illegal
       gratification, generation and laundering of proceeds of crime, and
       utilisation of such proceeds. Each allegation constitutes a distinct
       factual assertion requiring independent substantiation through
       objective material, including contemporaneous official records,
       statutory documents, financial trails, or statement of untainted
       witnesses. In the absence of such primary material, the approver’s
       version remains a narrative superstructure unsupported by a factual
       base. Law does not permit the superstructure to substitute the
       foundation.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 55 of 549
  109.                     An approver may corroborate facts otherwise proved; he
       cannot be the source from which the very existence of those facts is
       presumed. If alleged policy manipulation is not borne out from official
       records, if no contemporaneous material evidences the demand,
       quantification, payment, or receipt of illegal gratification, or if
       financial transactions stand explained by documentary commercial
       records, an approver’s ipse dixit cannot displace objective evidence.
       The same principle applies with equal force to allegations of money
       laundering and political utilisation of funds, where the existence of
       proceeds of crime and a demonstrable money trail are foundational
       requirements.

                                                             (emphasis supplied)

  110.                     The infirmity is further aggravated by the admitted
       position that the approver is himself a participant in the alleged offence
       and stands to gain personal liberty by turning approver. His statement
       is therefore inherently self-serving. Where the prosecution has failed
       to first establish the corpus of the alleged crime, the approver’s
       statement degenerates into a narrative aimed at deflecting personal
       culpability.

  111.                     Permitting an uncorroborated approver’s statement to
       substitute for foundational facts would invert settled principles of
       criminal jurisprudence. It would legitimise a process where arrest
       precedes proof, narrative precedes evidence, and facts are sought to be
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 56 of 549
       moulded to fit a confession. Criminal law does not countenance such
       an approach. The existence of the offence, the participation of the
       accused, and the requisite mens rea must be demonstrated through
       objective material before the Court can legitimately form even a prima
       facie view.

  112.                     Viewed thus, the statement of an approver, standing
       alone and unsupported by independent corroboration, does not
       ordinarily disclose legally sustainable incriminating material at the
       stage of charge. At best, it gives rise to suspicion; it does not generate
       grave suspicion. To treat such statement as sufficient even at the
       threshold would be to substitute sufficient ground to proceed with
       narrative convenience, an approach wholly alien to criminal
       jurisprudence and destructive of the rule of law.

       (b) Statements Recorded Under Section 161 of Cr.P.C. of an approver
       after grant of pardon and its evidentiary value:

  113.                     The Court observes that, in the instant matter,
       notwithstanding the recording of the confessional statement of the
       approver under Section 164 of the Cr.P.C. before the Ld. Judicial
       Magistrate, and subsequent to the recording of the approver’s
       statement under Section 306(4) of the CrPC following the grant of
       pardon, the investigating agency has proceeded to record multiple
       supplementary statements of the same approver under Section 161 of
       the CrPC. This gives rise to an important issue for the purpose of
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                     Page no. 57 of 549
       evidentiary appreciation at the stage of charge: how are such Section
       161 statements to be classified, and what weight can they carry?

  114.                     To answer this, the Court considers the legal position by
       applying a simple test: what would have been the evidentiary position
       if the person had not been granted pardon at all?

  115.                     If the person had not been granted pardon, he would
       have remained a co-accused and faced trial. In such a situation: (i) his
       confession would have been treated only as a confession of a co-
       accused within the limited scope of Section 30 of the Evidence Act;
       and (ii) any confession or incriminating statement made to police, or
       in police custody, would attract the bar under Sections 25 and 26 of
       the Evidence Act, rendering such confession inadmissible, except to
       the limited extent permitted by law.

  116.                   The Court notes that the evidentiary value of a co-accused
       confession is inherently weak. Such confession is not substantive
       evidence and does not even fall within the ordinary definition of
       “evidence” in the manner in which statement of a witness does. It can
       be used only in a limited way: where there is independent evidence
       against the accused which, if believed, is sufficient to support
       conviction, then the confession of the co-accused may be used only as
       an additional circumstance and not as the foundation.




CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 58 of 549
  117.                     It is for this reason that it is well settled that a charge
       cannot be framed solely on the confession of a co-accused, since such
       confession is not the kind of evidence which can, by itself, create grave
       suspicion. The same logic applies to confessional statements recorded
       by police in custody. Such statements are inadmissible in law, and the
       inadmissibility does not depend on what status the maker later
       acquires. The inadmissibility flows from the source and manner of
       recording. Therefore, what was inadmissible or legally weak when the
       maker was a co-accused cannot be elevated into stronger incriminating
       material merely because later he is tendered pardon. Reliance is placed
       upon the judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled as Suresh
       Budharmal Kalani vs. State of Maharashtra, (1998) 7 SCC 337.

  118.                     This is precisely why the law contemplates that pardon
       is tendered on the basis of a disclosure under Section 164 of CrPC, and
       not on the basis of a police statement under Section 161 of CrPC. The
       Court, therefore, observes, confined strictly to statements recorded
       under Section 161 of CrPC, that what was not admissible or reliable
       as confessional material earlier cannot become admissible or reliable
       merely due to the grant of pardon.

                                                                (emphasis supplied)

  119.                     Accordingly, the Court holds that the statements of an
       approver recorded under Section 161 of CrPC, insofar as they contain
       self-incriminating           or    co-accused-incriminating       confessional
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 59 of 549
       assertions, cannot be automatically treated at par with the approver’s
       judicial disclosure. Even if the Court were to look at them, their
       evidentiary worth would remain closer to the limited value attached to
       co-accused confession-type material and cannot be elevated to the
       same plane as approver statement in its proper form.

  120.                     The Court further notes that if, after pardon, the
       approver is again examined before a Magistrate under Section 164 of
       CrPC, then such statement may fall within the category of approver
       disclosure having a distinct footing. This distinction is material
       because approver statement, when properly recorded and later tested,
       carries a higher evidentiary value than a mere police statement.

  121.                     Recently, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has crystallised
       the legal position governing the evidentiary value of statements
       recorded under Section 161 of the Cr.P.C., the treatment of inculpatory
       and exculpatory statements attributed to an accused, and the
       confession of a co-accused, in the case titled P. Krishna Mohan Reddy
       v. State of Andhra Pradesh, 2025 SCC OnLine SC 1157, and has
       observed that:-

               “53…. From the above exposition of law, the following
               emerges:—
               (i) A person who is accused of an offence or named in the
               first information report, can be examined by the police and
               his statement may be recorded under Section 161 of the Cr.
               P.C., as held in Nandini Satpathy (supra).


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 60 of 549
               (ii) A statement of an accused under Section 161 of the Cr.
               P.C., would ordinarily be of two kinds, it may be inculpatory in
               nature or may be exculpatory in nature.
               (iii) An inculpatory statement again may be in the form of an
               admission or a confession. If such statement admits either a
               gravely incriminating fact or substantially all the facts which
               constitute the offence, respectively, as held in Pakala Narayana
               Swami (supra), then it amounts to confession.
               (iv) Where such police statement of an accused is confessional
               statement, the rigour of Section(s) 25 and 26 respectively will
               apply with all its vigour. A confessional statement of an
               accused will only be admissible if it is not hit by Section(s) 24
               or 25 respectively and is in tune with the provisions of
               Section(s) 26, 28 and 29 of the Evidence Act respectively. In
               other words, a police statement of an accused which is in the
               form of a confession is per se inadmissible and no reliance
               whatsoever can be placed on such statements either at the stage
               of bail or during trial. Since such confessional statements are
               rendered inadmissible by virtue of Section 25 of the Evidence
               Act, the provision of Section 30 would be of no avail, and no
               reliance can be placed on such confessional statement of an
               accused to implicate another co-accused.
               (v) A confessional statement of one accused implicating
               another co-accused may be taken into consideration by the
               court against such co-accused in terms of Section 30 of
               the Evidence Act, only at the stage of trial, where (1) the
               confession itself was relevant and admissible in terms of the
               Evidence Act; (2) was duly proved against the
               maker; (3) such confessional statement incriminates the maker
               along with the co-accused and; (4) both the accused persons in
               question are in a joint trial for the same offence.
               (vi) Furthermore, because such confessional statements are not
               “evidence” in terms of Section 3 of the Evidence Act as held
               in Bhuboni Sahu (supra), such a confession as held
               in Kashmira Singh (supra) can only be pressed into
               consideration by the court as a rule of prudence, to lend
               assurance to the other evidence against such co-accused,
               provided that aforesaid ingredients or conditions of Section
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 61 of 549
               30 read with Section(s) 24 to 29 of the Evidence Act, are
               fulfilled.
               (vii) Where the police statement of an accused is in the form of
               an admission, such inculpatory statement even if it implicates
               another co-accused cannot be taken into consideration against
               such co-accused in terms of Section(s) 17 read with 21 of
               the Evidence Act, as doing so would militate against the
               general principle, that an admission may be given as evidence
               against the maker alone. The exceptions to the aforesaid
               general principle carved out under the Evidence Act, do not
               permit the usage of such admission against a co-accused in any
               scenario whatsoever.
               (viii) Where the police statement of the accused is an
               exculpatory statement i.e., it is neither a confession nor an
               admission, the statement being one under Section 161, would
               immediately attract the bar under Section 162 of the Cr. P.C.,
               and the same may be used only for the very limited purpose
               provided in the Proviso for the purpose of contradiction or re-
               examination of such accused person alone, as held in Mahabir
               Mandal (supra). Even if such exculpatory statement of one
               accused, implicates another co-accused, the same cannot be
               taken into consideration against such co-accused, as there can
               be no credibility attached to an exculpatory statement of an
               accused implicating another co-accused, more particularly
               because it is neither required to be given on oath, nor in the
               presence of the co-accused, the same cannot be tested by cross-
               examination and the exculpatory nature of such statement
               militates against the foundational principle that permits taking
               into consideration a statement of one accused person against
               another co-accused as explained in Bhuboni Sahu (supra), i.e.,
               ‘when a person admits guilt to its fullest extent either to a
               certain incriminating fact or substantially all the facts which
               constitute the offence, and in doing so exposes himself and in
               the process other co-accused persons to the pain and penalties
               provided for the guilt, there exists a sincerity and semblance of
               sanction for the truthfulness of such statement….”.

  122.                     At this stage, it becomes necessary for the Court to
       clearly understand and delineate the legal distinction between a
       “confession” and an “admission”, particularly in the context of
       statements of an accused recorded by the police under Section 161 of
       the Cr.P.C.

  123.                     A confession is a statement by an accused which
       amounts to an admission of the offence itself, or at least of
       substantially all the facts which constitute the offence. In other words,
       a confession is a direct acknowledgment of guilt. An admission, on the
       other hand, stands on a different footing. An admission does not
       amount to acceptance of guilt for the offence as a whole, but relates
       only to the acknowledgment of one or more gravely incriminating
       facts which may form part of the prosecution case. This distinction has
       been judicially recognised, including in Pakala Narayana Swami v.
       Emperor, (1939) PC 47, where it was emphasised that every
       incriminating statement is not a confession.

  124.                     The legal consequences flowing from this distinction are
       significant. It is well settled that even a confession made by one
       accused cannot be used against a co-accused, except within the limited
       scope of Section 30 of the Indian Evidence Act, and that too only if
       the strict conditions prescribed therein are satisfied.

  125.                     As a natural corollary, any statement made by an
       accused under Section 161 of Cr.P.C. which merely amounts to an
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 63 of 549
       admission, that is, an acknowledgment of an incriminating fact or a
       statement implicating another person, would be governed by Section
       17 of the Evidence Act, read with the settled prohibition on the use of
       admissions against third parties. Such an admission is relevant, if at
       all, only against its maker, and even then subject to the statutory
       limitations governing police-recorded statements.

  126.                     It is trite law that an admission made by one accused
       cannot be used as evidence against another co-accused. The law does
       not permit the prosecution to rely upon statements of an accused,
       recorded by the police under Section 161 of Cr.P.C., to implicate a co-
       accused. Such statements are not substantive evidence and are hit by
       the well-established restrictions contained in the Evidence Act.

  127.                     Therefore, any statement of an accused recorded under
       Section 161 of Cr.P.C., insofar as it seeks to implicate a co-accused,
       whether by way of confession or by way of admission, cannot be
       looked into by the Court against such co-accused. To permit otherwise
       would amount to indirectly doing what the law expressly prohibits,
       namely, using police-recorded statements of one accused as evidence
       against another.

  128.                     It thus follows that any statement of an approver
       recorded under Section 161 of Cr.P.C. is rendered inadmissible by
       operation of Section 25 of the Indian Evidence Act, for the reason that
       a confessional statement, if at all, can be validly recorded only under
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 64 of 549
       Section 164 of Cr.P.C. by a Judicial Magistrate. The prosecution
       appears to proceed on the assumption that, upon tender of pardon, the
       approver is transmuted into an independent witness. Such an
       assumption is fundamentally flawed and untenable in law for the
       purpose of determine evidentiary value of such statement.

  129.                     In the first place, the statement of an approver is never
       assessed on the same footing as that of a general witness; it is
       scrutinised with circumspection, having regard to his admitted
       participation in the offence and the settled statutory and judicial
       safeguards governing approver evidence. In the second place, the
       status of an approver is itself conditional and precarious. Any
       infraction of the terms on which pardon is tendered exposes him to
       forfeiture of that status, rendering him liable to be tried once again as
       an accused. The taint of participation, therefore, continues to attach
       and cannot be wished away.

  130.                     The statutory scheme under Sections 306 and 308 of
       Cr.P.C casts a clear and substantive obligation upon the prosecution to
       ensure that an accused, upon being tendered pardon, “makes a full and
       true disclosure of the whole of the circumstances within his
       knowledge relative to the offence and to every other person concerned,
       whether as principal or abettor. “This condition cannot be treated as a
       mere formality, as it is intended to ensure that the approver is
       mandatorily required: (i) to make a full and true disclosure; (ii) of the

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 65 of 549
       whole of the circumstances within his knowledge; (iii) relative to the
       offence; and (iv) concerning every other person involved, whether as
       principal or abettor. These are the conditions subject to which pardon
       is tendered to the approver. Where, after the recording of the statement
       under Section 306(4) of Cr.P.C on this condition, the investigating
       agency proceeds to record further supplementary statements of the
       same approver under Section 161 of Cr.P.C., a serious issue arises as
       to compliance with the foundational requirement of full and true
       disclosure. If the material on record were to indicate otherwise, the
       statutory course available to the prosecution was to consider recourse
       to Section 308 of Cr.P.C for withdrawal of tender of pardon. The
       decision instead to record multiple subsequent supplementary
       statements under Section 161 of Cr.P.C. is, on the face of the record, a
       matter warranting close judicial scrutiny.

  131.                     That being so, this Court is unambiguous in holding that
       any statement of an approver recorded under Section 161 of Cr.P.C.
       after tender of pardon cannot be treated as substantive material, even
       for the purposes of consideration of charge. However, in order to test
       the prosecution case at its highest, and while extending the maximum
       latitude permissible at this preliminary stage, the Court deems it
       appropriate to examine such statements only as the version of an
       accomplice. This limited exercise is undertaken solely to assess
       whether, even on such an indulgent footing, the material on record

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 66 of 549
       crosses the legally mandated threshold for framing of charge. If the
       prosecution case fails to meet that standard even on this premise, it
       necessarily follows that no case for charge is made out.

  132.                     This discussion is necessitated by the heavy reliance
       placed by the prosecution on the supplementary statements of the
       approver recorded by the investigating agency under Section 161 of
       Cr.P.C., both prior and subsequent to the recording of his confessional
       statement under Section 164 of Cr.P.C. (pre pardon). and his
       confessional statement under Section 306(4) of CrPC (post pardon).
       The general foundational principles governing the evidentiary value
       of such statements have been set out hereinabove. Their specific
       inconsistencies, infirmities, and probative limitations shall be
       examined at the appropriate stage while considering those statements
       in detail.

       2. Statement of a Witness Making Incriminating Assertions Against
       Himself as well as against the accused persons in a Statement recorded
       under Section 161 of Cr.P.C.

  133.                     The issue that arises for consideration concerns the
       evidentiary value of a witness who is alleged to have participated in
       the crime, yet has neither been arrayed as an accused nor tendered as
       an approver, but has instead been examined as a prosecution witness.
       The question is whether such a witness can be treated at par with an
       ordinary witness who merely deposes to facts within his knowledge,
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 67 of 549
       or whether his statement stands on a distinct and legally circumscribed
       footing.

  134.                     This question assumes particular significance at the
       stage of framing of charge, where the Court is required to assess
       whether the material on record crosses the minimum threshold
       necessary to proceed against the accused. The complexity arises
       because the witness, examined under Section 161 of Cr.P.C., makes
       statements which are incriminating not only against the accused
       persons facing prosecution but also against himself.

  135.                     Recently, the Hon’ble Supreme Court, in Criminal Appeal
       No. 454 of 2015 (arising out of SLP (Criminal) No. 9928 of 2014), R.
       Dineshkumar @ Deena v. State, has categorically held, while referring
       to the judgments in Laxmipat Choraria and ors. vs. State of
       Maharashtra, 1968 SCR (2) 624 and A.R. Antulay vs. R.S. Nayak &
       another (1988) 2 SCC 602, that the prosecution is at liberty to examine
       one of the participants in the offence as a witness. However, the
       statement of such a witness is required to be assessed with the caution
       applicable to accomplice evidence. In other words, such statement is
       to be treated as being in the nature of accomplice evidence and cannot
       be accepted at face value without appropriate corroboration. The
       relevant extract is reproduced below for ready reference without any
       alteration:                                           (emphasis supplied)



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 68 of 549
               “54…. We have already taken note of the relevant facts and the
               decision of this Court in Choraria case. The relevant facts of
               A.R. Antulay case are as follows. Before the ‘trial Court’ it was
               contended by Antulay that the examination of some of his
               alleged co-conspirators as witnesses and proposal to examine
               some more of them is legally not tenable and they must be
               arrayed as accused. Such a contention was negated by the trial
               Judge. Aggrieved by the same, Antulay carried the matter in
               appeal to this Court. Unfortunately, the majority judgment did
               not consider this aspect. It is only Justice Venkatachaliah, as
               His Lordship then was, who in his dissenting judgment
               considered this aspect and held as follows:
               ‘133. ……… An accused person cannot assert any right to a
               joint trial with his co-accused. Normally it is the right of the
               prosecution to decide whom it prosecutes. It can decline to
               array a person as a co-accused and, instead, examine him as a
               witness for the prosecution. What weight is to be attached to
               that evidence, as it may smack of the statement of a guilty
               partner in crime, is a different matter. Prosecution can enter
               nolle prosequi against any accused person. It can seek to
               withdraw a charge against an accused person. These
               propositions are too well settled to require any further
               elaboration. Suffice it to say that the matter is concluded by the
               pronouncement of this Court in Laxmipat Choraria v. State of
               Maharashtra : 1968 Cri LJ 1124 where Hidayatullah, J. referred
               to the argument that the accomplice, a certain Ethyl Wong in
               that case, had also to be arrayed as an accused and repelled it,
               observing:
               Mr. Jethmalani’s argument that the Magistrate should have
               promptly put her in the dock because of her incriminating
               answers overlooks Section 132 (proviso).
               …The prosecution was not bound to prosecute her, if they
               thought that her evidence was necessary to break a smugglers’
               ring. Ethyl Wong was protected by Section 132 (proviso) of the
               Indian Evidence Act even if she gave evidence incriminating
               herself. She was a competent witness although her evidence
               could only be received with the caution necessary in all
               accomplice evidence.
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                            Page no. 69 of 549
               134. On this point, really, the appellant cannot be heard to
               complain. Of the so-called co-conspirators, some have been
               examined already as prosecution witnesses; some others are
               proposed to be so examined; and two others, it would appear,
               had died in the interregnum. The appeal on the point has no
               substance and would require to be dismissed. We must now
               turn to the larger issue raised in the appeal.’
               55. In the light of the above two decisions, the proposition
               whether the prosecution has a liberty to examine any person as
               a witness in a criminal prosecution notwithstanding that there
               is some material available to the prosecuting agency to indicate
               that such a person is also involved in the commission of the
               crime for which the other accused are being tried requires a
               deeper examination….”.
                                                            (emphasis supplied)

  136.                     The Hon’ble Supreme Court has recognised that the
       prosecution is not denuded of its liberty to examine such a participis
       criminis as a witness, even where some material exists to indicate his
       involvement in the offence. However, the law equally mandates that
       the evidence of such a witness cannot be placed on the same pedestal
       as that of a neutral or independent witness. The statement of such a
       witness can only be received with the caution applicable to accomplice
       evidence.

  137.                     The expression “all accomplice evidence” is of particular
       significance. The concept of an accomplice is not confined only to an
       approver but extends to any participant in the crime whose statement
       implicates himself. This includes, in principle, statements analogous
       to confessions of co-accused or approvers, though the evidentiary

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 70 of 549
       treatment accorded to each category differs, as explained in the
       preceding discussion. The distinction is material, since the probative
       value and the degree of corroboration required vary depending on the
       precise legal character of the statement relied upon.

  138.                     The jurisprudential basis for treating the statement of a
       witness who incriminates himself while also implicating other accused
       persons as accomplice evidence lies in the inherent nature of such
       statement, and not merely in the nomenclature assigned by the
       investigating agency. The mere circumstance that the prosecution has
       chosen to treat such a person as a “general witness” does not, in law,
       efface the taint arising from his admitted participation in the alleged
       offence.

                                                              (emphasis supplied)

  139.                     Where a witness acknowledges his own involvement in
       the commission of the crime, his statement is inevitably coloured by
       self-interest. In such a situation, the incentive to align with the
       prosecution case is, if anything, stronger than that of a formal
       approver. An approver, though tendered pardon, is required to undergo
       a statutorily prescribed and judicially supervised process under the
       Cr.P.C., and remains exposed to the risk of forfeiture of pardon upon
       any deviation from full and truthful disclosure. In contrast, a self-
       confessed participant who is extended the benefit of being examined
       as a regular witness, and is thereby insulated from prosecution without
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 71 of 549
       undergoing the rigours of the pardon procedure, enjoys complete
       immunity without corresponding safeguards.

                                                            (emphasis supplied)

  140.                     It would be wholly unrealistic to presume that a person
       who has admittedly participated in the offence would not avail such an
       opportunity to secure his own protection by supporting the prosecution
       narrative. The motivation to testify in a manner favourable to the
       prosecution, in order to avoid penal consequences, is thus manifest and
       cannot be ignored. The credibility of such a witness is, therefore,
       inherently suspect and stands on no higher footing than that of an
       accomplice.

  141.                     Consequently,    settled   principles    of      criminal
       jurisprudence mandate that the statement of such a witness must be
       approached with the same degree of circumspection as accomplice
       evidence. It is well-established that an accomplice is a witness
       unworthy of implicit reliance, and his statement cannot be acted upon
       unless it is independently corroborated on material particulars
       connecting the accused with the crime.

  142.                     This principle assumes particular significance in the
       present case, where the prosecution rests substantially upon the
       statements of a large number of witnesses who have, on their own
       showing, admitted participation in the alleged offence. To accept such


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 72 of 549
       statement at face value, without insisting upon independent
       corroboration on material particulars, would be to dilute well-settled
       safeguards evolved to prevent miscarriage of justice. The Court is,
       therefore, duty-bound to subject such evidence to heightened scrutiny
       and to apply the settled rule of corroboration with full rigour.

  143.                     The above legal position thus governs the appreciation
       of statements under Section 161 of Cr.P.C. made by witnesses who are
       themselves implicated in the offence, particularly at the stage of
       consideration of charge.

       (3) Accomplice, Accomplice-like Witness and Approver- Comparative
       and Inter Se Analysis of Evidentiary Value.

  144.                  The position of law governing accomplice and accomplice-
       like statement stands settled by authoritative pronouncements of the
       Hon’ble Supreme Court. In Laxmipat Choraria (supra) and A.R.
       Antulay (supra), it has been recognised that a witness who
       incriminates himself and other accused persons, though not formally
       tendered pardon as an approver, remains a competent witness.
       However, such evidence is required to be scrutinised with the same
       caution as that of an accomplice. The consequence is that, while
       admissible, it must receive independent corroboration on material
       particulars, in the same manner as approver statement.




CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 73 of 549
  145.                     In that background, the issues fall for consideration in
       the form of the following queries:

       (a) Whether accomplice-like statement can be treated as “independent
       corroboration” of the approver on material particulars?

  146.                     The corroboration required for approver evidence must
       be independent in character and must connect the accused with the
       commission of the offence in material particulars. Such corroboration
       cannot proceed from a source equally tainted or similarly interested.
       Where a witness himself stands in the position of an accomplice or
       accomplice-like participant, being exposed to criminal liability in the
       same transaction, his statement carries the same infirmity. As a rule of
       prudence, therefore, accomplice-like statement cannot constitute
       independent corroboration of an approver. Evidence emanating from a
       tainted source does not acquire independence merely because it
       supports another tainted witness.

       (b) Whether accomplice-like statement can corroborate another
       accomplice-like statement and thereby lend credibility to the
       approver?

  147.                     If two witnesses are participants in, or complicit with,
       the same transaction, both stand on an identical evidentiary footing.
       The infirmity attaching to one equally attaches to the other. It is well
       settled that one accomplice cannot corroborate another within the


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 74 of 549
       meaning of Illustration (b) to Section 114 of the Evidence Act. Mere
       repetition of a version by similarly placed witnesses does not
       transform suspicion into reliability; it only reproduces evidence of the
       same quality. Consequently, accomplice-like statement cannot be
       relied upon to bolster another accomplice-like statement so as to
       furnish the independent assurance required for acting upon approver
       evidence.

       (c) Whether the statement of one approver can be used to corroborate
       the statement of another approver ?

  148.                     It has been consistently held that the statement of one
       approver is not sufficient corroboration of another. The doctrinal basis
       is that corroboration must come from an independent source. An
       approver is, by definition, a tainted source. Corroborative evidence
       must (i) be independent of accomplice evidence, (ii) connect the
       accused with the offence, (iii) relate to material particulars, and (iv)
       provide assurance of the truthfulness of the accomplice regarding the
       participation of the accused. Evidence of another accomplice does not
       satisfy these requirements, as it lacks the essential element of
       independence.

  149.                     The position stands settled in K. Hashim v. State of T.N.,
       (2005) 1 SCC 237, subsequently followed by the Bench of three
       Judges of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Somasundaram alias Somu v.
       State, (2020) 7 SCC 722, wherein it was observed that corroboration
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 75 of 549
       must come from independent sources and ordinarily the statement of
       one accomplice would not suffice to corroborate that of another.
       Though in exceptional circumstances a conviction so based may not
       be illegal, the rule of prudence requiring independent assurance
       remains unaffected.

  150.                     The significance of the aforesaid principles assumes
       particular importance at the stage of determination of charge in the
       present case, where the prosecution relies upon statements of
       approvers as well as witnesses who are themselves alleged participants
       in the transaction. It is well settled that the confession of a co-accused
       cannot be the sole basis for framing of charge, as held by the Hon’ble
       Supreme Court in Suresh Budharmal Kalani (supra). Where the
       material consists predominantly of approver statements and
       accomplice-like statement, the Court is required to examine whether
       there exists independent material connecting the accused with the
       alleged offence. At the stage of charge, the prosecution must cross the
       threshold of grave suspicion; if two views are reasonably possible on
       the material placed on record. In the absence of independent
       corroboration on material particulars, reliance upon mutually
       reinforcing tainted statement would not satisfy the standard required
       even for proceeding to trial.

       C. Rationale for Close Judicial Examination of Witness Statements in
       a Policy-Driven Conspiracy Case

  151.                     From the very outset, it becomes necessary to delineate
       why this Court is required to closely examine the statements of
       witnesses relied upon by the prosecution. The nature of the case itself
       makes such scrutiny unavoidable, as the prosecution narrative is
       founded substantially on the statement of approvers rather than on
       direct, self-proving documentary or physical evidence of statements of
       witnesses recorded during the course of investigation.

  152.                     The prosecution case, as projected, rests predominantly
       on oral versions to establish serious allegations relating to
       manipulation of a public policy, demand and payment of alleged up-
       front illegal gratification and their subsequent laundering. These
       allegations are sought to be supported by a set of circumstances which,
       according to the prosecution, point towards the existence of a criminal
       conspiracy. Such circumstances are neither self-evident nor self-
       proving and, by their very nature, invite close judicial scrutiny even at
       the threshold.

  153.                     The prosecution further seeks to draw a chain of
       circumstances from the evolution of the excise framework by
       juxtaposing clauses of the earlier excise policy with provisions
       introduced under the DEP-21/22, and to project these changes as
       tailor-made to benefit select private parties. In doing so, the case enters
       a technically complex domain involving regulatory provisions,
       licensing conditions, and structural changes in the excise regime. The

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 77 of 549
       allegations also span a wide commercial canvas, implicating a large
       number of entities operating at different levels of the excise supply
       chain, manufacturers, wholesalers and retail licensees, whose
       respective roles and inter se relationships form an integral part of the
       prosecution narrative.

  154.                     At the stage of consideration of charge, the Court is not
       expected to undertake a roving or exhaustive enquiry into these
       matters, nor to adjudicate upon the correctness of the prosecution’s
       inferences. At the same time, the Court cannot be reduced to a passive
       recipient of the prosecution version. The settled position of law
       mandates that the Court must apply its judicial mind to the material
       placed on record and examine whether the circumstances relied
       upon, taken cumulatively and at their face value, disclose the essential
       ingredients of the alleged offences and give rise to a grave suspicion,
       as opposed to a mere suspicion founded on conjecture or hindsight
       analysis.

                                                               (emphasis supplied)

  155.                     Where the prosecution alleges a complex conspiracy
       involving policy formulation, alleged clandestine monetary flows, and
       multi-layered commercial transactions across numerous entities, the
       Court is necessarily required to test whether the circumstances relied
       upon are proximate, coherent and capable of forming a prima facie
       chain. This exercise involves examining whether the statements of
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 78 of 549
       approvers and witnesses, read with the surrounding circumstances
       relating to policy clauses, licensing structures, and the participation of
       wholesalers and retailers, prima facie lend assurance to the prosecution
       case. Such scrutiny, confined strictly to the parameters of prima facie
       assessment, does not amount to a “mini trial”, as the Court neither
       weighs competing versions nor tests credibility through cross-
       examination.

       (D) Relied-Upon Documents and Statements of Witnesses

  156.                     The investigating agency is entitled to rely upon such
       documents and statements of witnesses as it considers relevant for
       supporting the prosecution case and the conclusions claimed to emerge
       from the investigation. These relied-upon materials alone form the
       foundation of the prosecution at the stage of consideration of charge.

  157.                     It is well settled that, at this stage, the Court confines its
       examination to the documents and statements expressly relied upon by
       the prosecution. Unrelied documents or statements are not taken into
       consideration for determining whether a prima facie case or grave
       suspicion is disclosed. Though such unrelied material is ordinarily not
       supplied to the defence along with the charge-sheet, the investigating
       agency is nevertheless required to furnish a list of unrelied documents
       and to permit inspection thereof, so as to ensure fairness and
       transparency in the investigative process.


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                             Page no. 79 of 549
  158.                     This legal position enables the defence to demonstrate,
       on the basis of the prosecution’s own relied-upon material, that the
       evidence is insufficient to raise grave suspicion against the accused, or
       that the record does not disclose the foundational facts necessary to
       attract the essential ingredients of the alleged offences. At this stage,
       the defence is not required to establish its case or prove innocence; it
       is sufficient to show that even if the prosecution material is taken at its
       face value, it does not warrant the framing of charge.

                                                             (emphasis supplied)

  159.                     Accordingly, the relied-upon documents and statements
       must be examined in their entirety to assess whether they, taken
       cumulatively, disclose a prima facie case. Where any document or
       statement relied upon by the prosecution does not support its case, or
       runs contrary to the prosecution narrative, such material cannot be
       ignored. Being part of the prosecution’s own evidentiary basis, it is
       entitled to due consideration, and the prosecution cannot be permitted
       to rely selectively upon favourable portions while disregarding
       material that dilutes or undermines its own case.

                                                             (emphasis supplied)

  160.                     The purpose of this limited judicial examination is to
       ensure that the criminal process is not set in motion on the strength of
       broad allegations or technical assertions divorced from a coherent


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 80 of 549
       factual foundation. A reasoned assessment of whether the prosecution
       material, even if assumed to be true, is capable of sustaining the
       alleged offences is an integral part of the statutory duty of the Court at
       the stage of framing of charge. Any contention that such an exercise
       amounts to conducting a mini trial is, therefore, misplaced.

       (E) Consideration of Submissions and Scope of Adjudication

  161.                     The Court has had the benefit of extensive arguments
       advanced by the Ld. Special Public Prosecutor for the CBI as well as
       by the Ld. Counsel appearing on behalf of the respective accused. The
       submissions addressed before the Court covered the allegations set out
       in the charge-sheets, the material placed on record, and the legal
       objections raised at this stage. The written submissions filed by the
       parties have also been examined. All contentions, whether on facts or
       in law, have been taken into consideration and are dealt with in the
       paragraphs that follow. It is made clear that the scrutiny undertaken at
       this stage is strictly confined to the documents and statements of
       witnesses relied upon by the prosecution.

  162.                     For the sake of continuity and to avoid repetition, the
       brief gist of the submissions of the parties is set out in Annexure-A and
       shall form part of this order. The discussion that follows proceeds on
       the basis of the material so placed before the Court, without restating
       the submissions in detail.


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 81 of 549
  163.                     Having regard to the fact that as many as twenty-three
       accused persons have been arrayed in the present case, the
       appreciation of the prosecution material is being undertaken in a
       structured and phased manner to ensure clarity and coherence. At the
       outset, the material relating to the public servants, namely Accused
       Nos. A-8, A-1, A-2 and A-18, shall be examined individually, having
       regard to the distinct nature of the allegations attributed to them in
       their official capacity.

  164.                     Thereafter, the Court shall proceed to consider the role
       attributed to Accused Nos. A-3, A-4, A-5, A-6, A-7, A-9, A-10, A-11,
       A-17 and A-23, whose alleged involvement is projected primarily in
       relation to the formulation, implementation and ancillary transactions
       connected with the policy.

  165.                     Lastly, a consolidated analysis shall be undertaken qua
       Accused Nos. A-12, A-13, A-14, A-15, A-16, A-21 and A-22, who are
       alleged to be connected with the movement of the purported upfront
       money, stated to have been routed to Goa and utilised for election-
       related purposes.

  166.                     The sequencing is adopted purely for analytical
       convenience and does not imply any pre-judgment on the merits of the
       allegations against any of the accused.

       Approach to Evaluation of Alleged Conspiracy — Cumulative and
       Individual Assessment

  167.                     Before adverting to the specific allegations, it is
       necessary to note that the prosecution case rests substantially on a
       series of alleged meetings stated to have been held at different places
       and attended by multiple accused persons. The narrative presented
       seeks to knit these meetings and surrounding circumstances into a
       continuing conspiracy. The same set of events has been relied upon to
       attribute both a collective design and specific roles to individual
       accused.

  168.                     In examining the material on record, this Court shall
       analyse the facts from two perspectives. First, cumulatively, to assess
       whether the circumstances taken together disclose the ingredients of a
       criminal conspiracy in law. Second, individually, to determine whether
       the material qua each accused satisfies the threshold required at this
       stage. Since the allegations are interlinked and overlapping, the same
       meetings, documents, statements and surrounding circumstances may
       require consideration more than once, at times collectively, and at
       times in the context of a particular accused.

  169.                     The Court is conscious that such an approach may
       involve repetition, including reference to the same facts and even to
       the same legal principles. However, given the structure of the
       prosecution case and the manner in which common circumstances are
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 83 of 549
       projected against different persons, a truncated discussion would not
       subserve the ends of justice. As observed by the Hon’ble Supreme
       Court in Ramesh Kumar Bhagchandaka v. State of Uttar Pradesh,
       ARISING FROM SLP (CIVIL) NOS.20045-20046/2024, “No doubt,
       brevity is the soul of precision but not at the cost of completeness.”

  170.                     Guided by the aforesaid principle, the discussion that
       follows may, at places, revisit the same material; such reiteration is
       undertaken to ensure clarity, completeness and proper evaluation of
       the case as against each accused.

       APPRECIATION                OF     PROSECUTION           MATERIAL             FOR
       DETERMINATION OF A PRIMA FACIE CASE

       Allegation against A-8

  171.                     The   allegation   relating   to   the   formulation        and
       implementation of the DEP-21/22 has, in substance, been placed at the
       doorstep of A-8, who, at the relevant time, was serving as Deputy
       Chief Minister and was holding the portfolio of the Excise
       Department. The prosecution narrative consistently projects him as the
       principal architect and controlling force behind the alleged conspiracy,
       as well as the central decision-making authority in matters of policy
       design, approval and implementation. In that view of the matter, and
       in order to preserve continuity and analytical clarity, it is appropriate



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 84 of 549
       to first examine the case qua A-8 before adverting to the role attributed
       to the remaining accused.

  172.                     Broadly stated, the case against A-8 rests on four
       interlinked pillars. First, it is alleged that during the process of
       formulation of the policy, certain recommendations of the Ravi
       Dhawan Committee report dated 13.10.2020 were deliberately
       sidelined, modified or not adopted, and that such departures were
       calculated to favour select private liquor interests. The prosecution has
       placed reliance upon the first draft GoM report dated 15.03.2021, the
       second draft report dated 19.03.2021 and the final report dated
       22.03.2021. It has been asserted with emphasis that the report dated
       19.03.2021 was nothing but a document handed over by members of
       the ‘South Group’ and prepared at their instance. The prosecution
       further seeks to suggest that key provisions, such as the 12% wholesale
       margin, the one-wholesaler-per-manufacturer structure, relaxed
       eligibility norms and dilution of related-entity restrictions, were
       introduced or structured in a manner conferring undue advantage,
       contrary to Expert Committee recommendations and without
       documented deliberation. It is further alleged that fabricated public
       feedback was generated in January 2021 in order to create an artificial
       basis for such departures. The gravamen of the charge, therefore, is not
       mere deviation from recommendations, but deviation accompanied by
       intent to confer pecuniary benefit.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                    Page no. 85 of 549
  173.                     Secondly, reliance is placed upon the alleged removal or
       non-placement of a draft Cabinet Note dated 28.01.2021, which,
       according to the prosecution, contained adverse legal opinions not
       aligned with the final policy framework. It is contended that A-8
       suppressed such opinions by removing and causing the disappearance
       of the said Cabinet Note, the last conscious custody of which is
       attributed to him. The prosecution further alleges that he thereafter
       initiated a fresh Cabinet Note and orchestrated the constitution of a
       GoM as a façade, personally authoring and finalising GoM drafts on
       the basis of 36 pages allegedly handed over by A-3 and recovered from
       devices seized from his office.

  174.                     Thirdly, the prosecution alleges a broader criminal
       conspiracy between A-8 and certain private individuals and business
       entities described as members of the “South Group.” It is alleged that
       during the policy-drafting phase, A-8 maintained back-channel
       communication with A-3 (Vijay Nair) and exercised overarching
       influence over the Excise Department to facilitate licence grants and
       suppress scrutiny, particularly in favour of M/S Indospirits belonging
       to A-7. Though it is not alleged that he directly handled cash, he is
       accused of having knowledge of, and consenting to, the generation and
       recovery of illegal gratification of approximately ₹90-100 crores
       through intermediaries.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 86 of 549
  175.                    Fourthly, the theory of proceeds of crime is superimposed
       upon the policy narrative. It is alleged that once the policy enabled
       higher margins or concentrated control in the wholesale and retail
       segments, funds were generated and routed through intermediaries and
       later utilised for electoral purposes. It is further alleged that A-8
       obstructed the investigation by discarding or destroying mobile
       phones and suppressing material records, thereby attracting offences
       under Sections 120-B and 201 IPC read with the relevant provisions
       of the PC Act. The alleged financial trails are thus sought to be traced
       back to policy-level decisions attributed to him.

  176.                     It is evident that, in the prosecution’s presentation, the
       alleged acts of the other accused are portrayed as flowing from, or
       being facilitated by, the policy architecture attributed to A-8. If the
       foundational allegation of manipulation at the stage of formulation
       does not withstand scrutiny, the derivative allegations concerning
       conspiracy, generation of illegal gratification and alleged proceeds of
       crime would necessarily require independent and convincing material
       to sustain them.

  177.                     Equally, the institutional setting in which the policy
       came to be framed cannot be overlooked. The formulation of an excise
       policy is not an isolated ministerial act. It ordinarily involves
       recommendations of expert bodies, deliberations within the
       Department, examination by the Finance and Law Departments,

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 87 of 549
       consideration by the Council of Ministers and, within the
       constitutional framework governing the National Capital Territory of
       Delhi, interaction with the office of the Hon’ble Lieutenant Governor
       (hereinafter be referred to as “Hon’ble LG”). The attribution of
       criminal intent to a policy decision must therefore be tested against
       this collective and layered decision-making process, and not viewed
       in isolation.

  178.                     For these reasons, it would be appropriate to examine, in
       a structured manner, the material placed on record qua A-8. This would
       require scrutiny of the documentary trail, including committee reports,
       departmental notings, GoM deliberations, Cabinet approvals and
       communications with the Lieutenant Governor’s Secretariat;
       assessment of whether the alleged deviations amount to policy choices
       within administrative discretion or disclose prima facie mala fides; and
       evaluation of whether any cogent linkage is established between the
       impugned policy clauses and the alleged monetary transactions.

  179.                     Only after such an examination can the role attributed to
       the other accused be meaningfully considered, since, on the
       prosecution’s own showing, their alleged participation is premised
       upon the central role ascribed to A-8 in the formulation and
       implementation of the DEP-21/22.

  180.                     Before proceeding to examine the specific allegations
       against A-8, this Court considers it appropriate to first undertake a
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 88 of 549
       prima facie examination of the relevant policy documents, namely, the
       Ravi Dhawan Committee Report dated 13.10.2020, the first draft GoM
       Report dated 15.03.2021, the subsequent draft dated 19.03.2021, the
       GoM Report dated 22.03.2021, and the Minutes of Meeting dated
       05.04.2021.

  181.                     This exercise is undertaken for a limited purpose. The
       documents are to be read sequentially and on their own terms, without,
       at this stage, importing the allegations surrounding the formulation
       process. The object is to ascertain whether the progression reflected in
       these reports discloses an organic and incremental development of
       policy. The endeavour in the ensuing discussion is confined to a plain
       reading of these reports to assess whether the trajectory of policy
       change, as emerging from the documents themselves, prima facie
       discloses any design indicative of conspiracy, preferential treatment to
       any particular group, or the creation of cartelisation or monopoly.

       (A) Scope and Limits of Judicial Scrutiny-Preliminary Clarification
       Before Examination of Policy Reports

  182.                     At the outset, this Court deems it appropriate to clarify
       the limited compass within which the Ravi Dhawan Committee
       Report, the GoM Report, and the documents culminating in the
       DEP-21/22 are being examined. It is not the province of a criminal
       court to evaluate the wisdom, advisability, or economic soundness of
       a public policy. The formulation of policy falls within the executive
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 89 of 549
       domain, and courts do not substitute their views for those of the policy-
       maker.

  183.                     The present scrutiny arises only because the prosecution
       alleges that the very formulation and implementation of the
       DEP-21/22 were tainted by criminal conspiracy. In that context, it
       becomes necessary for this Court, at least on a prima facie appraisal,
       to consider whether the material on record suggests that the policy was
       the result of a structured and consultative administrative process, or
       whether it discloses circumstances indicative of a pre-conceived
       conspiracy. The exercise undertaken is thus confined to determining
       whether the threshold required for framing of charge,namely, the
       existence of grave suspicion, is satisfied.

  184.                   It is significant that the Ravi Dhawan Committee Report,
       the GoM Report, and the subsequent policy documents are not
       disputed by either side. Their authenticity is not in question. They form
       part of the admitted documentary record. Where such documents are
       contemporaneous and form part of the official decision-making
       process, they must be read in their plain terms. While oral statement
       may vary in quality and reliability, documentary records, especially
       those generated in the ordinary course of governmental functioning,
       provide an objective account of events and deliberations.

                                                              (emphasis supplied)


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 90 of 549
  185.                   The assessment that follows is, therefore, undertaken only
       to ascertain whether the prosecution’s allegation of conspiracy finds
       prima facie support in the admitted documentary framework, or
       whether the record reflects an institutional policy development. This
       Court reiterates that it is neither adjudicating upon the merits of the
       policy nor expressing any opinion upon its desirability; the enquiry is
       confined strictly to the question whether the material discloses the
       essential ingredients of conspiracy at this stage.

       (i) Structural Framework of the Supply Chain (Earlier Policy vis-à-vis
       DEP-21/22)

  186.                     Before adverting to the specific recommendations
       contained in the Ravi Dhawan Committee Report, the successive draft
       reports of the GoM, and the eventual crystallisation of those
       deliberations into the DEP-21/22, it is considered appropriate, for the
       sake of analytical clarity, to first delineate the structural framework
       within which the excise regime operated. A comparative depiction of
       the supply chain under the earlier policy, as contrasted with the
       framework introduced under DEP-21/22, facilitates a clearer
       understanding of the structural realignment that is the subject of
       scrutiny in the present proceedings.

  187.                     This exercise is undertaken only to place the competing
       policy frameworks in perspective. It is not intended to pronounce upon
       the relative merits of either regime, but to provide a neutral structural

       backdrop against which subsequent policy modifications may be
       examined.




CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                           Page no. 92 of 549
  188.                     The above depiction sets out, in schematic form, the
       architecture of the two regimes. It clarifies the operational structure
       prevailing prior to DEP-21/22 and the structural adjustments
       introduced thereafter. The examination of the Ravi Dhawan
       Committee recommendations, the draft GoM reports dated
       15.03.2021, 19.03.2021 and final GoM report dated 22.03.2021, and
       the final GoM Minutes culminating in the DEP-21/22 must be viewed
       against this foundational framework.

  189.                     The comparative flow chart thus serves as an analytical
       aid, enabling the Court to assess subsequent clauses and alleged
       deviations within their proper structural context.

       (ii) Structural Vulnerabilities in the Pre-Policy Wholesale–Retail
       Architecture and the Committee’s Recommendation for Functional
       Separation by Ravi Dhawan Committee Report

  190.                     A cumulative reading of the Report indicates that the
       Committee identified a structural vulnerability in the prevailing
       architecture, wherein the supply chain functioned as: “Distillery
       outside Delhi → Wholesale licenses (L-1) → Retail licenses.” Within
       this structure, the Committee recorded: “Manufacturers may be able
       to acquire retail licenses through proxy ownership in the existing
       system,” and further observed: “As a result of depot operations,
       significant savings in terms of overhead costs, labour costs and rentals


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 93 of 549
       shall be made by the manufacturers who are also presently engaged in
       wholesale operations.”

  191.                     The Report therefore recognises that manufacturers were
       not confined to production alone but were “presently engaged in
       wholesale operations,” and, by way of proxy ownership, were in a
       position to influence the retail layer as well. Such vertical alignment
       inevitably resulted in structural concentration of control and the
       retention of financial advantages across different tiers of the
       distribution chain.

  192.                     The magnitude of the financial incentive inherent in the
       system was also candidly acknowledged: “The incentive to cheat is
       huge because of the very nature of the commodity, fast selling and
       highly taxed. A single bottle of liquor, where duty is not paid, not only
       leaves the state high and dry in terms of revenue but also pushes the
       profit margins from 10-15% to 65-70%, as the major component of the
       price is duties viz. Excise duty and VAT…”

  193.                     The Report further records: “Non-duty paid liquor having
       duplicate barcodes were found in retail stores which is not possible
       without the complicity of the wholesaler…”. Thus, duplication of
       barcoding and the circulation of non-duty paid liquor were identified
       as systemic concerns, and the role of the wholesaler was treated as
       central to such irregularities.


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 94 of 549
  194.                     The Report also makes a comparative revenue
       observation: “The revenue contribution by the Government vends is
       almost equal to private sector inspite of 40% more government vends.
       The average contribution per vend of government corporation in terms
       of Excise Duty is Rs. 5 crores p.a. in comparison to Rs. 8 crores p.a.
       per private vend.” While the Report does not expressly connect the
       lower per-vend revenue of corporation outlets with duplication or Non
       Duty Paid Liquor, the revenue differential, when viewed alongside the
       admitted presence of barcode duplication in retail stores, reflects that
       vulnerability within the system was not demonstrably confined to one
       category of outlet. The document records the disparity but does not
       conclude that corporation-operated vends were insulated from similar
       risks.

  195.                     In response to the perceived concentration of control and
       the attendant risk of leakage, the Committee recommended: “IMFL
       trade should be revamped by bringing the entire wholesale
       operations under one government entity,” so as to: “break the link
       between manufacturers and retailers by ensuring that all stocks are
       now routed only through this corporation.”

  196.                     However, when the acknowledgement of lower revenue
       performance of corporation vends is considered together with the
       identified issues of duplication and Non Duty Paid Liquor, the
       assumption that a Government corporation, by its character alone,

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 95 of 549
       would function free from the possibility of corruption or leakage does
       not arise as a finding supported by comparative material within the
       Report. The Committee points to structural deficiencies in the earlier
       vertically integrated model and proposes functional separation; yet the
       proposition that wholesale control by a Government entity would, by
       itself, eliminate the risks of duplication, evasion or mismanagement is
       not established on any empirical analysis contained in the Report.

       (iii) Evolution of Wholesale Margin Structure in Draft Reports-
       Examination of Alleged Enhancement

  197.                     The prosecution seeks to construct a narrative that the
       draft dated 19.03.2021 was not an institutional document but a
       privately prepared text, allegedly printed at the instance of A-4, routed
       through A-3 and handed over to A-8, thereby suggesting that the
       wholesale margin of 12% was inserted at the behest of the so-called
       “South Group” to facilitate recoupment of alleged upfront payments.

  198.                 When the two drafts are placed side by side, the foundation
       of this hypothesis requires careful scrutiny. The draft dated 15.03.2021
       expressly provided: “6. There will be no cap on distributor margin
       set by the Govt. and brands can individually set that with their chosen
       distributor. A 5% minimum distribution fees will be mandatory to
       ensure no undercutting takes place between L1 license holders which
       will indirectly affect the quality of liquor being supplied and to ensure


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 96 of 549
       no malpractices take place under the guise of a lower distribution
       %.”.

  199.                     A plain reading of this clause reveals three clear
       features:
       (i) No upper cap was prescribed by the Government;
       (ii) The distributor margin was left to be negotiated between brand and
       distributor; and
       (iii) Only a minimum distribution fee of 5% was mandated to prevent
       undercutting.

  200.                     Thus, under the first draft, the margin was open-ended,
       subject only to a minimum threshold. There was no ceiling. The
       wholesaler could, in theory, negotiate margins beyond 12%, if the
       commercial arrangement so permitted.

  201.                     It is in this backdrop that the investigating agency has
       sought to project that in the second draft report there was an abrupt
       increase of wholesale margin from 5% to 12% from the first draft
       report to the second draft report. The relevant portion of para 16.16 of
       the first supplementary charge-sheet reads: “… It has been revealed
       that in this draft GoM report, the profit margin for wholesalers (L-1
       licensee) was abruptly increased from 5% to 12% of EDP + Import
       Fee. Further, the eligibility criterion of turnover for wholesalers (L-1
       licensee) was also increased from Rs.100 crores to Rs.500 crores,
       every year for the past 05 years.”
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 97 of 549
  202.                     The above assertion proceeds on the premise that the
       first draft report dated 15.03.2021 fixed the wholesale margin at 5%.
       The document itself does not support that reading. The clause in the
       first draft report categorically records that there would be no cap on
       distributor margin and that brands could individually set the margin
       with their chosen distributor, subject only to a minimum of 5%. In
       contrast, the draft dated 19.03.2021 records: “GoM recommends
       simplification of the price fixation. A standard distribution fee to be
       fixed @ 12% of EDP + Import Fee. The 12% distributor margin will
       cover the significantly higher level of investment required for global
       distribution standards, freight & insurance and a reasonable profit for
       the distributor. The reasonable margin will eliminate the need to
       indulge in unethical practices.”

  203.                     What emerges, therefore, is not a transition from a fixed
       5% to 12%, but a transition from no cap (with a 5% minimum) to a
       standardised 12%. The first draft did not prescribe a 5% ceiling; it
       prescribed only a floor. The second draft replaced a flexible regime
       with a uniform rate. It is also of significance that the investigating
       agency has not alleged manipulation in the first draft. The allegation
       of manipulation is directed only against the second draft, and that too
       on the premise that the wholesale margin was enhanced to facilitate
       recoupment. If the first draft had culminated into the final policy, the
       wholesaler entities such as M/S Indospirit and M/S BSPL, who are

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 98 of 549
       alleged to be part of the conspiracy for recoupment, would have
       operated under a regime with no upper cap on distributor margin. Such
       an arrangement, in theory, provided a wider commercial latitude and a
       greater opportunity to accumulate higher margins. The second draft,
       by introducing a standardised 12% margin, curtailed that flexibility.

                                                             (emphasis supplied)

  204.                     It is difficult to reconcile this with the prosecution’s
       hypothesis that the so-called conspirators were engineering a policy
       solely to maximise recoupment. A policy that replaces an uncapped
       negotiable margin with a fixed standard cannot, on its face, be said to
       enlarge the scope for windfall accumulation. If anything, it narrows
       discretion. The suggestion that a group would design a framework
       disadvantageous to its own alleged objective renders the theory
       internally inconsistent.

                                                              (emphasis supplied)

                Conduct of Investigating Officer and impact on fair
                 investigation.

  205.                     The portrayal of this change as an “abrupt increase from
       5% to 12%” is not borne out from the text of the document. A
       conclusion of manipulation cannot rest upon attributing to the earlier
       draft a position it never adopted. An investigating agency is expected
       to place the record before the Court fairly and in its correct context. A

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 99 of 549
        selective reading that ignores the explicit statement that there would
        be no cap on distributor margin and proceeds as though the earlier
        draft fixed the margin at 5% does not assist the Court. The record must
        be read as it stands. On a plain reading of the two drafts, the hypothesis
        of conspiracy, built upon an alleged increase from 5% to 12%, does
        not withstand textual scrutiny.

        (iv) Enhancement of Turnover Criteria for L-1 Licence-Examination of
        Prosecution’s Theory of Elimination of Competition.

   206.                     Another circumstance relied upon by the prosecution is
        the enhancement of the eligibility criteria for grant of L-1 licence in
        the second draft. It is suggested that the turnover requirement was
        increased from ₹100 crores every year for the past five years (as
        reflected in the first draft report) to ₹500 crores every year for five
        years in the subsequent second draft report, and that such enhancement
        was introduced at the instance of the so-called “South Group” to
        eliminate competition. It is further relevant that in the final GoM report
        the threshold was moderated to ₹250 crores every year for three years,
        and in the final DEP-21/22 it stood reduced to ₹150 crores every year
        for past three years.

   207.                     The prosecution projects the second draft as the decisive
        stage where competition was allegedly sought to be curtailed by
        raising the turnover benchmark. However, this position does not
        appear to align with the factual material on record. The very entity

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 100 of 549
        alleged to be beneficiaries of the conspiracy, M/S Indospirit, were
        themselves confronted with difficulty in meeting the turnover
        requirement. The material placed before the Court indicates that M/S
        Indospirit Marketing Private Limited (M/S IMPL) struggled on the
        turnover criterion and was unable to satisfy even the reduced
        benchmark of ₹150 crores in the final policy, leading to withdrawal of
        its application and a subsequent attempt under the name of M/S
        Indospirit. If the prosecution theory is that the eligibility threshold was
        deliberately raised to eliminate competitors and secure advantage for
        conspirators, the fact that the alleged conspirators themselves faced
        disqualification on the very same turnover condition introduces a
        serious inconsistency. A clause that renders the supposed beneficiaries
        ineligible cannot, on its face, be described as a provision crafted
        exclusively for their benefit.

                                                            (emphasis supplied)

   208.                     The sequence of drafts further shows a movement in
        figures, from ₹100 crores to ₹500 crores, then to ₹250 crores for three
        years, and ultimately to ₹150 crores in the notified policy. This
        progression reflects revision and recalibration rather than a one-
        directional enhancement intended to permanently exclude market
        participants. Numerical thresholds in policy formulation are often
        reassessed in light of feasibility and market considerations.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 101 of 549
   209.                     Viewed in this context, the allegation that the turnover
        clause was engineered solely to eliminate competition and facilitate
        recoupment becomes difficult to sustain. The very premise of
        conspiracy, that the framework was structured to secure wholesale
        profits for particular entities, stands diluted if those entities were
        themselves rendered ineligible under the proposed conditions. A
        conspiracy theory that rests on provisions which disqualify its alleged
        beneficiaries cannot be accepted at face value. The shifting turnover
        criteria, read in their entirety, do not by themselves establish that the
        second draft was manipulated to eliminate competition for the benefit
        of a predetermined group. On the contrary, the record indicates that
        the eligibility clause operated uniformly and did not carve out any
        express or implied exemption in favour of the alleged conspirators.


        (v) Related Entities (51% Ownership/Control)

   210.                Upon a careful and holistic consideration of the material on
        record, this Court finds that the incorporation of the “related entities”
        concept, anchored in a majority ownership/control threshold of 51%
        (or more than 50%), in clause 3.1.2 (vii) of the DEP-21/22 cannot, by
        any stretch of reasoning, be characterised as a novel, arbitrary, or
        conspiratorial innovation. A plain reading of the draft reports shows
        that while the principle of separation between manufacturer,
        wholesaler and retailer existed from the beginning, the specific


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 102 of 549
        definition of “related entities” did not form part of the earlier drafts.
        The drafts dated 15.03.2021, 19.03.2021 and 22.03.2021 referred in
        general terms to “sister concerns,” “proxy entities,” and indirect
        ownership, but did not prescribe any quantified or structured test. The
        detailed formulation, incorporating the 51% majority ownership
        criterion, prohibition of common proprietors/partners/directors, and
        exclusion of holding, subsidiary relationships, appears for the first
        time       in     the    Minutes   dated   05.04.2021,    when     the       GoM
        recommendations were considered at the level of the Council of
        Ministers.

   211.                     This sequence is of relevance. The definition of “related
        entities” was not embedded in any of the earlier draft reports, including
        the draft dated 19.03.2021 which is alleged to have been created by
        the so-called “South Group.” It was introduced subsequently during
        governmental deliberation. On the face of the documents, what
        emerges is institutional formalisation at the stage of ministerial
        consideration, not insertion at the draft stage attributed to private
        individuals. On the contrary, the adoption of a majority-control test is
        a well-recognised and time-tested regulatory technique employed
        across Central Government statutes, procurement frameworks, and
        competition-law jurisprudence to address the mischief of cartelisation,
        concentration of economic power, and circumvention of eligibility
        norms through proxy or group entities.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 103 of 549
   212.                  It is a matter of record that Indian regulatory architecture
        repeatedly treats entities under common control or majority ownership
        as belonging to the same economic group. Statutory and policy
        instruments, ranging from company law (holding–subsidiary
        relationships), foreign-exchange regulations (beneficial ownership
        exceeding 50%), to Government tender and PPP documents
        (definitions of “associate” or “affiliate” based on control through more
        than 50% voting rights), consistently adopt this threshold to ensure
        that competition is real and not illusory. The rationale is self-evident:
        where control vests in the same controlling mind, formal corporate
        separateness cannot be permitted to defeat the object of fair
        competition. Viewed in this backdrop, the 51% criterion employed in
        the DEP-21/22 is not an outlier but falls squarely within the
        mainstream of Indian regulatory practice.

   213.                          Equally significant is what preceded the DEP-21/22.
        Neither the earlier Excise Policy nor the Ravi Dhawan Committee
        Report recommended or even contemplated a structured “related
        entities” prohibition. In such a framework, absent an express
        restriction on common ownership or control, manufacturers, by
        deploying subsidiaries, group companies, or front entities, would have
        had a clear and unhindered pathway to vertically influence or
        indirectly control retail operations, thereby frustrating both
        competition and consumer-interest objectives.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 104 of 549
   214.                 The Court cannot lose sight of the fact that policy design
        must respond not only to past experience but also to foreseeable
        market behaviour. The introduction of the “related entities” clause in
        the DEP-21/22 addresses precisely this regulatory gap. It operates as a
        preventive safeguard, ensuring that privatisation of retail does not
        degenerate into disguised vertical integration or group dominance, and
        that the market structure remains competitive rather than cartel-prone.
        Far from being a suspicious deviation, the clause represents a course
        correction aligned with competition principles and administrative
        prudence.

   215.                  Viewed thus, the “related entities” concept based on 51%
        ownership/control serves a legitimate, rational, and policy-consistent
        purpose. It strengthens the architecture of the DEP-21/22 by closing
        avenues of indirect control, promotes genuine competition, and
        protects against monopoly formation. The absence of such a provision
        in earlier policies or advisory reports cannot be weaponised to impugn
        its later introduction; rather, it underscores the necessity and maturity
        of the reform undertaken. In the considered opinion of this Court, the
        clause confers benefit and robustness upon the DEP-21/22, and cannot
        prima facie be read as indicative of any ulterior design or
        conspiratorial intent.

   216.                     At this juncture, it must also be noted that the
        prosecution’s attack on the DEP-21/22 is, in its very formulation, self-

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 105 of 549
        destructive. The very clauses projected as arbitrary, tailor-made, or
        conspiratorial, namely those relating to the definition of related
        entities, structural separation, and competitive safeguards, operate in a
        manner that negates, rather than advances, the allegation of
        cartelisation or group-centric benefit. Measures designed to dismantle
        common control, prevent vertical integration, and restrict dominance
        cannot logically be invoked as instruments to favour a particular
        group. The prosecution’s narrative thus collapses under its own
        weight: the policy features assailed as suspicious are, in substance and
        effect,       those      which   strengthen   competition    and     constrain
        concentration. Far from lending support to the theory of undue benefit
        to the so-called “South Group”, these provisions, when examined in
        their correct regulatory context, affirm the defence case that the
        DEP-21/22 was structured to disperse control, curb monopoly, and
        promote a level playing field.


        (vi) Retail Vends: Alleged Cartelisation and Adoption of Auction Model

   217.                     Upon consideration of the material placed on record, this
        Court finds that the recommendations of the Ravi Dhawan Committee
        report and those of the GoM are substantially aligned on the question
        of privatisation of retail vends. The GoM, in essence, adopted the
        Committee’s recommendation that retail trade in Delhi be privatised.
        The divergence projected by the investigating agency pertains not to


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 106 of 549
        privatisation per se, but to the method of allocation, the adoption of an
        auction-based model in place of the lottery-based mechanism adverted
        to in the Committee’s report.

   218.                     The prosecution asserts that the shift to auction-based
        allocation facilitated cartelisation in the retail segment by enabling
        concentration of retail zones in the hands of certain entities. However,
        the mere selection of auction as a mode of allocation, in preference to
        lottery, cannot by itself be elevated to a circumstance indicative of
        criminal design. The choice between auction and lottery lies within the
        domain of policy and economic governance. Each model is capable of
        yielding varied market outcomes. In the absence of material
        demonstrating manipulation of bids, distortion of eligibility, or
        procedural impropriety in allocation, the inference of conspiracy
        cannot rest solely upon the adoption of one permissible allocation
        mechanism over another.

                                                              (emphasis supplied)

   219.                     It is also of relevance that the policy simultaneously
        introduced safeguards to address apprehensions of cartelisation and
        vertical integration. The stipulation that manufacturer, wholesaler
        (L-1), and retailer could not be held by “related entities” constitutes an
        express structural barrier against cross-tier concentration. The
        incorporation of such disqualification norms reflects a regulatory
        intent to prevent consolidation across levels. The existence of these
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 107 of 549
        anti-concentration safeguards does not readily match with the
        allegation that the framework was consciously structured to enable
        cartel formation.

   220.                     This Court also cannot overlook the contextual backdrop
        in which the DEP-21/22 was formulated. The policy emerged during
        a period marked by unprecedented fiscal strain occasioned by the
        Covid-19 pandemic. State revenues had suffered severe contraction
        owing to lockdown measures, while expenditure obligations expanded
        significantly to address public health exigencies. Governments across
        the country, confronted with similar constraints, recalibrated revenue-
        generating mechanisms. The choice of an auction-based model, which
        ordinarily assures competitive bidding and potentially enhanced
        revenue realisation, cannot be divorced from that fiscal context. Policy
        formulation must be appreciated as a response to the economic
        realities prevailing at the relevant time.

   221.                     An instructive feature of the record is the statement of
        the prosecution’s own witness, Sikander Mann (PW-2). He has stated
        that he is the owner of ADS Spirits Private Limited, manufacturer of
        the brand “Royal Green,” and that he and his family members operate
        approximately 60 liquor retail vends in the State of Haryana. This
        statement discloses that a manufacturing entity and its promoters are
        simultaneously associated with a considerable number of retail outlets
        within a single State.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 108 of 549
                                                                (emphasis supplied)

   222.                     This Court is neither required nor inclined to examine
        the excise framework of the State of Haryana. The significance of the
        statement lies in the factual position it reveals. The presence of
        substantial retail concentration in the hands of one family, which is
        also connected with manufacturing activity, demonstrates that such
        aggregation is not a phenomenon confined to the DEP-21/22. It is also
        borne out from the policy record that the structural changes introduced
        in DEP-21/22 were expressly aimed at addressing concerns of
        monopoly and cartelisation. In that backdrop, mere concentration
        cannot, by itself, sustain an inference of policy-driven impropriety.
        Structural concentration may emerge under varied regulatory models,
        and its existence alone does not establish criminality.

                                                                (emphasis supplied)

   223.                      From the standpoint of the prosecution’s own case, it is
        significant that no allegation has been advanced that the bidding
        process of retail vends in Delhi was vitiated by manipulation, irregular
        evaluation, or misconduct on the part of the TEC. There is no assertion
        that bids were unlawfully structured, that eligibility criteria were
        selectively relaxed, or that the allocation process was procedurally
        compromised. The challenge is directed at the model itself, not at its
        implementation.


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 109 of 549
   224.                     The allegation of cartelisation is further attenuated by
        the factual matrix concerning M/S KGRL. The record indicates that
        M/S KGRL was unsuccessful in the initial round of bidding, wherein
        only 20 vends were allotted. The remaining vends were subsequently
        re-bid, and it was at that stage that M/S KGRL succeeded. This
        sequence does not, prima facie, reflect a pre-arranged or assured
        allocation.

   225.                     Beyond M/S KRGL and Magunta Farms Ltd., the
        prosecution has not established that any other entity was directly or
        indirectly connected through ownership interest in an L-1 wholesaler.
        Nor is it the case of the prosecution that manufacturers were
        structurally linked to wholesalers or retailers in contravention of the
        related-entity norms. When the broader narrative is examined,
        manufacturers, who were central to the concerns recorded in the Ravi
        Dhawan Committee Report regarding vertical integration, do not
        emerge as beneficiaries of the alleged cartelisation under the new
        framework.

                                                               (emphasis supplied)

   226.                     On an overall appraisal, what emerges from the material
        is not demonstrable evidence of a cartel engineered through auction-
        based allocation, but a policy shift accompanied by express anti-
        concentration safeguards, implemented through a bidding process that
        has not been shown to be procedurally flawed. The theory that the
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 110 of 549
        adoption of auction-based retail allocation was itself a vehicle for
        cartelisation does not find prima facie support from the reports
        anyalised above.


        (vii) Concluding Assessment on the Evolution of the Policy Framework

   227.                     A cumulative reading of the Ravi Dhawan Committee
        Report, the draft GoM reports dated 15.03.2021, 19.03.2021 and final
        report dated 22.03.2021, together with the Minutes of Meeting dated
        05.04.2021, indicates a visible progression in policy formulation
        rather than any abrupt or discontinuous shift. On a plain and sequential
        reading of the documents placed, the draft dated 15.03.2021, followed
        by the drafts dated 19.03.2021 and final GoM report dated 22.03.2021,
        and thereafter the Minutes incorporating suggestions on 05.04.2021,
        what emerges is continuity in structure with calibrated refinement in
        detail.

   228.                     Certain core elements remain consistent throughout:
        (i) Separation of manufacturer from wholesale (no manufacturer to
        hold L-1);


        (ii) Prohibition on L-1 owning retail vends;
        (iii) Requirement of a professionalised wholesale structure;
        (iv) Introduction of mechanisms to curb spurious or non-duty paid
        liquor;


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                     Page no. 111 of 549
        (v) Consolidation of L-1/L-1F permissions into a unified L-1
        framework;
        (vi) Exclusive sale by L-1 to retail vends;
        (vii) Provision for cancellation and forfeiture upon violation.

   229.                     These structural pillars do not appear to have been
        introduced suddenly at a later stage; rather, they persist across drafts.

   230.                     At the same time, there are discernible calibrations in
        quantitative thresholds:


        Wholesale Turnover threshold:
        • 15.03.2021 – ₹100 crores every year for past 5 years;
        • 19.03.2021 – ₹500 crores every year for past 5 years;
        • 22.03.2021 – ₹250 crores every year for past 3 years (excluding the
        Covid year);
        • 05.04.2021– ₹250 crores every year for past 3 consecutive years.


        Wholesale Experience requirement:
        • 15.03.2021 – 10 years;
        • 19.03.2021 – 10 years;
        • 22.03.2021 – reduced to 5 years;
        • 05.04.2021 – framed in broader terms, linked to professional
        standards with turnover criteria retained.


        Wholesale Annual licence fee:

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 112 of 549
        • 15.03.2021 – ₹10 crores;
        • 19.03.2021 – ₹10 crores;
        • 22.03.2021 – reduced to ₹5 crores;
        • 05.04.2021 – no material contradiction.


   231.                     Such variation suggests calibration in response to
        internal deliberation, economic feasibility, and anticipated market
        participation. The exclusion of the Covid year in the 22.03.2021 GoM
        report is contextual and reflects a pragmatic adjustment rather than a
        structural deviation. There is no material in these successive drafts
        indicating introduction of an entirely new structural concept at a late
        stage, removal of safeguards in favour of a particular class, sudden
        tailoring of eligibility criteria for a named entity, or abandonment of
        the principle of separation between manufacturer and retail.

   232.                 Instead, the trajectory reflects tightening, loosening, and re-
        balancing of quantitative thresholds, turnover, years of experience,
        licence fee, while retaining the same architectural framework of the
        wholesale model. When this evolution is read alongside the concerns
        recorded in the Ravi Dhawan Committee Report, namely, vertical
        integration of manufacturers into wholesale and retail, concentration
        of control, vulnerability to non-duty paid liquor and duplication of
        barcodes, and systemic incentives for evasion, the subsequent drafts
        appear to respond to identified deficiencies. The separation of


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 113 of 549
        manufacturing from wholesale, prohibition of cross-ownership,
        structured eligibility norms, and refinement of distribution margins
        reflect attempts to address monopoly tendencies and regulatory
        leakages under the earlier regime.

   233.                     At the same time, while the policy sought to break
        manufacturer-level dominance and curb circulation of non-duty paid
        liquor, the restructuring inevitably shifted operational control towards
        entities qualifying at the wholesale and retail levels. In practical terms,
        commercial influence moved from manufacturers to large-scale
        wholesalers and retailers capable of meeting eligibility benchmarks.
        The earlier vertical monopoly was sought to be dismantled; however,
        concentration of economic weight at downstream tiers was a
        foreseeable regulatory consequence.

                                                                  (emphasis supplied)

   234.                     From a neutral analytical standpoint, what is visible is an
        iterative drafting process, proposals examined, modified, and refined
        over a short span, culminating in the Minutes dated 05.04.2021, which
        incorporate earlier suggestions in structured form.


   235.                     Whether         such   evolution   amounts    to      organic
        development or manipulation cannot be inferred merely from the
        presence of modification. Fiscal and regulatory policy formulation
        commonly                 involves   balancing   revenue   objectives,      market
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                            Page no. 114 of 549
        participation, administrative feasibility, and legal safeguards. The
        mere alteration of thresholds or licence fees, absent material
        demonstrating targeted tailoring or concealed insertion, does not by
        itself establish manipulation.


   236.                     On the material presently examined, the sequence
        reflects progressive crystallisation of a wholesale model in response to
        earlier systemic concerns. A conclusion of criminal manipulation
        would require independent material demonstrating that the changes
        were introduced to favour identified beneficiaries or were inconsistent
        with the declared objectives of reform. Such inference does not arise
        solely from the textual progression of these drafts. At this stage, the
        Court is concerned only with whether the broad structural shift, taken
        in isolation, gives rise to a prima facie inference of criminality. On
        such limited scrutiny, no such inference arises merely from the fact of
        privatisation or the incorporation of new regulatory clauses.



        (B) Analysis on the Specific Allegations against A-8

   237.                     The prosecution has levelled specific allegations against
        A-8 alleging manipulation and criminal conspiracy during the
        formulation of the policy. Those allegations are required to be
        examined independently and on their own evidentiary footing. The
        inquiry at this stage is confined to determining whether the material

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 115 of 549
        placed on record, if taken at face value, is sufficient to cross the
        threshold for framing of charge.

   238.                     The Court shall, therefore, proceed to consider each
        imputed allegation qua A-8 separately, confining itself to the material
        placed on record, for the limited purpose of determining whether the
        ingredients of the alleged offences are disclosed and whether a prima
        facie opinion warranting framing of charge is made out.


   239.                     In order to appreciate the sequence in which events
        unfolded, from the constitution of the Ravi Dhawan Committee to the
        eventual coming into force of the DEP-21/22, it becomes necessary to
        set out the chronology in a structured manner. The formulation of the
        policy was not a singular act but the result of a series of steps,
        deliberations, draft reports, inter-departmental exchanges, and
        approvals extending over a defined period of time.


   240.                     To bring clarity to this progression, and to avoid any
        disjointed appreciation of isolated documents, the date-wise sequence
        and flow chart of material events is delineated below in a structured
        form. This chronological presentation is intended to provide a coherent
        narrative of the policy-making process, enabling the Court to assess
        the allegations in their proper temporal context rather than in
        fragmented isolation.

        (i) Allegation Regarding Suggestions Attributed to the Hon’ble Lieutenant
        Governor (Qua A-8)

   241.                     Turning now to the allegations against A-8, the Court
        first considers the issue arising from the statement of Sh. Anil Baijal


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 119 of 549
        (PW-86), who was the Hon’ble LG at the relevant time when the
        DEP-21/22 was under formulation.

   242.                     The prosecution case is that although the concerned file,
        along with notings, was sent to the office of the Hon’ble LG for his
        views, only one suggestion was in fact made by him. It is alleged,
        however, that seven suggestions were subsequently reflected as having
        been proposed by the Hon’ble LG. This forms a central plank of the
        prosecution’s case on the aspect of alleged manipulation.

   243.                     The allegation assumes significance, as it concerns the
        acts and recorded views of a constitutional authority and places two
        versions in direct contest. The matter therefore requires careful
        scrutiny, particularly at the stage where the Court is required to
        examine whether the material on record discloses grounds to proceed
        further in accordance with law.

   244.                     The statement of the Hon’ble LG, examined as PW-86,
        is of primary relevance and must be read along with the
        contemporaneous official record. Equally material are the statements
        of the senior officers associated with the Lieutenant Governor’s
        Secretariat, namely PW-87 (Smt. Ankita Mishra Bundela, Secretary to
        the Hon’ble LG) and PW-88 (Sh. Ajay Kumar, Additional Secretary to
        the Hon’ble LG), who were entrusted with the examination, movement
        and recording of file notings in the ordinary course of governmental
        business.

   245.                     Before adverting to the statements of the witnesses
        bearing on the present allegation, it would be apposite to reproduce the
        relevant file notings as contained in D-138. For ease of reference, the
        scanned notings relating to the above discussion are set out below:-

   246.                     PW-88,    who     was    directly   responsible     for       the
        examination and movement of the file, explains the constitutional
        framework governing the subject in the following terms:

        “…Excise comes under the ‘Transferred Subject’, which comes under
        the domain of GNCT of Delhi as per the provisions of Article 239 AA
        of the Constitution of India. Further, as per Sub-Clause (4) of the
        Article 239 AA of the Constitution of India, in case of difference of
        opinion between the Lieutenant Governor and his Ministers on any
        matter, the Lieutenant Governor shall refer it to the President for
        decision and act according to the decision given thereon by the
        President and pending such decision it shall be competent for the
        Lieutenant Governor in any case where the matter, in his opinion, is
        so urgent that it is necessary for him to take immediate action, to
        take such action or to give such direction in the matter as he deems
        necessary….”

   247.                     He further clarifies, with reference to Rule 23(viii) of the
        Transaction of Business Rules, that the submission of matters of
        administrative importance to the Lieutenant Governor is contemplated
        by the Rules: “…On being asked, I have to say that as per Rule 23
        (viii) of Transaction of Business of the Government of National
        Capital Territory of Delhi Rules 1993, any proposal or matter of
        administrative importance which the Chief Minister may consider
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                            Page no. 126 of 549
        necessary can be submitted to the Lieutenant Governor through the
        Chief Secretary and the Chief Minister before issuing any orders
        thereon.”

   248.                     Thus, the forwarding of the file to the Lieutenant
        Governor cannot be characterised as extraordinary; it was consistent
        with the governing Rules.

   249.                     PW-88 also describes the procedure adopted during the
        Covid period for file processing within the LG Secretariat:
        “…..considering his health condition, necessary precautions were
        taken while processing the files received in the LG Secretariat for the
        perusal / approval of the Hon’ble LG. During this period, after
        receiving any file in the LG Secretariat for perusal / approval of the
        Hon’ble LG, generally the same used to be analyzed and processed by
        the concerned staff officer with assistance of the concerned section.
        However, physical files were normally not used to be sent to the
        Hon’ble LG. Instead of the same, internal notes used to be prepared
        and processed on the computer system (Google docs) by the staff
        officer to the Secretary / Principal Secretary to LG. The internal notes
        used to include the brief of proposal, preliminary scrutiny of the
        proposal, if required, legal aspects if any etc. The internal notes used
        to be sent through Google docs to the Hon’ble LG by me through the
        Principal Secretary/Secretary to Hon’ble LG. Then, as per the
        directions/approval of the Hon’ble LG, the decisions/observations

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 127 of 549
        were used to be conveyed on the physical file to the concerned
        department/Minister/CS by the Senior Officers of LG Secretariat. The
        hard copies of the internal notes containing directions/approval of
        the Hon’ble LG used to be kept in the records in the LG Secretariat. I
        have to further say that on some occasions, keeping in view the
        requirement and the urgency of the matters, some physical files were
        also used to be sent to the Hon’ble LG for his perusal / signature.”

   250.                     PW-88, in his statement, supports the administrative
        sequence reflected from the record and explains the manner in which
        files were handled during the relevant period. He states that, owing to
        the Covid-19 situation, internal processing was largely undertaken in
        digital form instead of the usual physical circulation of files. Proposal
        briefs, scrutiny notes and legal comments were prepared electronically
        and forwarded to the office of the Hon’ble LG through the Principal
        Secretary/Secretary concerned. He further clarifies that the internal
        notes were first generated and shared digitally, and upon receipt of
        directions or approval, the same were printed and placed in the
        physical file. The hard copies containing such directions were retained
        as part of the official record in the ordinary course.

   251.                     The statement of PW-88, therefore, indicates that the
        procedure adopted during that period involved digital transmission
        followed by physical incorporation in the file, consistent with



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 128 of 549
        administrative functioning under the constraints prevailing at the
        time.

   252.                     PW-87 corroborates this institutional engagement. She
        further states: “The proposed excise policy was deliberated in detail in
        the LG Secretariat and the apparent deficiencies in the policy were
        discussed with Hon’ble LG in multiple meetings along with the
        officers of the LG Secretariat.”. She clarifies: “I also state that
        informal discussion notes were prepared by the LG Secretariat for the
        discussion. However, as far as I remember, such notes for discussion,
        being informal, are generally not kept on record.”

   253.                     This part of the statement indicates that multiple
        meetings took place and the excise policy was deliberated in detail.

   254.                     Significantly, PW-87 also states that on 19.05.2021, the
        Hon’ble LG informed her that the matter had been discussed with the
        Hon’ble Chief Minister and the Hon’ble Deputy Chief Minister and
        that the policy could not be concurred with in its present form,
        pursuant to which she returned the file with the contemporaneous
        noting: “The instant matter was discussed by Hon’ble Lt. Governor
        with Hon’ble Chief Minister and Hon’ble Deputy CM. The file is
        being returned accordingly.”

   255.                     Although PW-87 clarifies that she “was not privy to the
        discussion,” her official noting remains the sole contemporaneous

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 129 of 549
        documentary record of the outcome of that discussion. This
        contemporaneous endorsement assumes significance, as it evidences
        consultation at the highest executive level prior to further processing.

   256.                     Similarly, PW-88 states: “In the said file, there was a note
        put up by Dy.CM Sh. Manish Sisodia, Dy.CM on 20.05.2021, in which
        he mentioned seven points to be incorporated in the draft Excise
        Policy in pursuance of discussions among Hon’ble LG, Hon’ble CM
        and Dy. CM. In the said Note, Dy. CM asked Secretary Finance to
        prepare a proposal for the Cabinet incorporating the seven changes
        and marked the file to the Secretary Finance. Thereafter, fresh
        approval of the Council of Ministers was taken on the Cabinet Note
        and on 21.05.2021, Dy. CM noted in the file that “suggestions made
        by Hon’ble LG, in our meeting with him, have been approved by the
        Council of Ministers” and sent the file to CM, who marked the file to
        Hon’ble LG on the same day, i.e., 21.05.2021. On 24.05.2021, I as
        Additional Secretary to the Hon’ble LG noted in the file that “Hon’ble
        LG has been apprised” and sent the file to Secretary to CM for further
        necessary action.”

   257.                     PW-88 further states that the note dated 20.05.2021
        recorded by the Deputy Chief Minister reflected points arising out of
        discussions held with the Hon’ble LG and the Worthy Chief Minister.
        He deposes that on 21.05.2021 it was noted that the suggestions
        attributed to the Hon’ble LG had received approval of the Council of

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                            Page no. 130 of 549
        Ministers. The file was thereafter returned on 24.05.2021 with the
        endorsement, “Hon’ble LG has been apprised.”

   258.                     This sequence of contemporaneous notings indicates that
        the inputs were treated within the administrative record as having
        emanated from the Hon’ble LG and were processed accordingly in the
        course of official decision-making. PW-88 and PW-87 both confirm
        the receipt and return of the file with the endorsement “Hon’ble LG
        has been apprised.” The documentary trail thus consistently reflects
        that seven suggestions were recorded as having arisen from
        discussions and were thereafter incorporated upon approval by the
        Council of Ministers.

   259.                     Significantly, neither PW-87 nor PW-88 has disputed the
        contents of these notings. The record further shows that the file
        remained under consideration in the LG Secretariat for a considerable
        duration, indicating institutional scrutiny rather than mechanical
        processing. Upon return of the file, it was categorically recorded that
        the suggestions stood incorporated in the policy, and the Deputy Chief
        Minister expressly noted their approval by the Council of Ministers.
        The subsequent endorsement “Hon’ble LG has been apprised,”
        recorded by PW-88 in discharge of official duty, demonstrates that the
        developments were communicated and placed before the Hon’ble LG.
        No allegation of fabrication, interpolation or tampering of these
        notings has been made by any witness.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 131 of 549
   260.                     It further emerges that the Excise Policy file was
        received in the LG Secretariat on multiple subsequent occasions,
        namely on 09.11.2021, 30.11.2021, 01.04.2022 and 05.04.2022; yet,
        no contemporaneous objection was recorded disputing the reference
        to seven suggestions.

   261.                     The next question that arises for consideration concerns
        the impact of the denial attributed to the Hon’ble LG in respect of the
        six suggestions alleged not to have emanated from him. This aspect
        must be examined within the confined scope of scrutiny permissible at
        the stage of framing of charge. At this juncture, the Court is not
        expected to undertake an exhaustive assessment of rival versions; its
        inquiry is limited to examining whether the material placed on record,
        if accepted at face value, warrants further consideration in accordance
        with law.

   262.                     Viewed in that light, the contemporaneous official
        notings assume central significance. The record contains specific
        endorsements and entries made in the regular course of governmental
        functioning, forming part of the official file. Equally relevant are the
        statements of the officers who dealt with and processed the file in the
        LG Secretariat. Their depositions, rendered in discharge of official
        duties, and the official notings recorded by them, do not support the
        version now attributed to the Hon’ble LG. On the contrary, they reflect



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 132 of 549
        a consistent administrative narrative that discussions were held and
        that consequential entries were made in the file.

   263.                     The core question, therefore, is whether the Hon’ble LG
        can be permitted, in law, to deny the contents of official notings which
        stand explained, processed and effectively accepted by PW-87 and
        PW-88 in their statements. When the officers who handled the file
        have categorically spoken to the notings and have not alleged any
        fabrication or misattribution, the permissibility of a subsequent denial
        must be examined against the binding evidentiary value of the official
        record.

                                                              (emphasis supplied)

   264.                     In the limited enquiry permissible at this stage, where
        the Court is not to weigh evidence, but only to ascertain whether the
        material discloses a prima facie position, the contemporaneous
        documentary trail and the consistent statements of the officers dealing
        with the file assume determinative significance. Where the official
        record and the version of the responsible officers run contrary to the
        subsequent denial, the latter cannot be viewed in isolation from the
        institutional record.

   265.                     The notings forming part of the governmental file are
        official records maintained in the regular course of business by a
        public authority. They fall within the ambit of public documents as

        contemplated under Section 74 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
        Section 35 of the Act, 1872 as under:

                “An entry in any public or other official book, register or
                record, stating a fact in issue or relevant fact, and made by a
                public servant in the discharge of his official duty, or by any
                other person in performance of a duty specially enjoined by the
                law of the country in which such book, register or record is
                kept, is itself a relevant fact.”
   266.                     Certified copies thereof are admissible under Sections
        76 and 77. The entries in the present file were made by public servants
        while discharging official functions and form part of a regularly
        maintained governmental record. They record, contemporaneously,
        the movement of the file, the noting of suggestions and the
        endorsements made in the course of decision-making. Such entries,
        having been made in discharge of official duty, attract the statutory
        recognition contemplated under Section 35.

   267.                     Once the record is produced from proper custody and no
        plea of fabrication, interpolation or tampering is raised, its existence
        and tenor cannot be brushed aside. The weight to be attached to the
        contents is a matter of appreciation; however, the authenticity of an
        official record maintained in the ordinary course of governmental
        business cannot be casually disputed. In the absence of any challenge
        to its genuineness, the contemporaneous notings stand unimpeached
        and cannot be displaced at a later stage by a mere oral variation.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 134 of 549
   268.                     The evidentiary scheme of the Indian Evidence Act
        reinforces this position. Where the terms of a transaction, deliberation
        or official act have been reduced to writing, the document itself
        constitutes the best evidence of its contents. It is well-settled principle
        that when the contents of a document are in issue, oral evidence cannot
        be admitted to contradict, vary, add to or subtract from the written
        record, save in limited circumstances specifically provided by law. The
        official file notings in the present case are contemporaneous,
        authenticated and form part of the statutory record of governmental
        functioning. They expressly record that discussions took place with
        the Hon’ble LG and that “suggestions” emanating from such
        discussions were incorporated and approved.

   269.                     In the absence of any plea of fabrication, interpolation or
        want of authority, the law does not permit the contents of such a
        document to be nullified by a subsequent oral denial. An oral statement
        disputing the existence or number of suggestions, when the written
        record speaks otherwise, cannot override the documentary evidence.
        The proper course, if the record were inaccurate, would have been to
        challenge its authenticity or to plead and prove tampering. No such
        case is set up.

   270.                     Accordingly, so long as the official notings remain
        unchallenged in their genuineness, a mere oral assertion that only one
        suggestion was made cannot be treated as legally sufficient to displace

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 135 of 549
        a written record that reflects seven suggestions having been discussed
        and incorporated. The law accords primacy to the document itself. The
        statement of the Hon’ble LG disputing the seven suggestions, in the
        face of the contemporaneous official record, cannot therefore prevail
        in law over the contents of the document.

                                                               (emphasis supplied)

   271.                     PW-86, while stating that he did not issue “suggestions”
        in the sense of prescribing policy clauses or commercial parameters,
        does not deny that observations or views were conveyed during
        scrutiny. His statement, read harmoniously with the documentary
        record, can only be understood in the limited sense that he did not
        dictate commercial specifics. It cannot be read as a negation of the
        deliberative inputs contemporaneously recorded by PW-87 and
        PW-88. Where the terms of a transaction or event are reduced to
        writing, the document itself constitutes the best and exclusive
        evidence of its contents. The official file notings, contemporaneous
        and authenticated, expressly record that discussions took place with
        the Hon’ble LG and that “suggestions” emanating from such
        discussions were approved by the Council of Ministers. Any
        subsequent oral assertion that no suggestion was given cannot, in law,
        override or contradict this written record, particularly at the threshold
        stage of framing of charge.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 136 of 549
   272.                     The administrative engagement of the Hon’ble LG did
        not cease with policy formulation. The subsequent handling of files
        relating to L-7 vends in non-conforming areas, where the Hon’ble LG
        imposed conditions regarding DDA/MCD approvals, responded to
        further notes of the Deputy Chief Minister, and constituted
        committees,              demonstrates   continued   involvement      in       the
        implementation phase. When the file was again routed to the Hon’ble
        LG in relation to these matters, the earlier chain of notings remained
        intact and undisputed.

   273.                     Even in the complaint dated 20.07.2022 (D-61)
        forwarded by the Hon’ble LG Shri V.K. Saxena, which preceded the
        registration of the FIR, there is no allegation that the suggestions were
        recorded without consultation or that the official notings were
        fabricated or misrepresented. The complaint does not allege any
        fabrication of the official notings. This omission assumes significance.
        If the contemporaneous official record reflecting consultation and
        apprisal is neither disowned nor challenged at the inception, the
        subsequent projection of unilateralism or concealment stands
        materially weakened. Juxtaposed with the statement of PW-3, Shri
        Praveen Kumar Rai, Director, Ministry of Home Affairs, who deposes
        that the Office Memorandum dated 22.07.2022 was issued for
        forwarding “the complaint received from Hon’ble LG of GNCTD,
        Shri Vinai Kumar Saxena,” to the Director, CBI “for necessary

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 137 of 549
        action”, it becomes evident that the very constitutional office that was
        institutionally involved in the policy process later initiated the
        complaint.

                                                                      (emphasis supplied)

   274.                     This aspect, though perhaps not decisive in isolation,
        assumes considerable importance when examined in the broader
        context of the prosecution’s theory of conspiracy. The position taken
        by PW-86 must be viewed against the institutional and legal
        consequences that would inevitably follow from an unqualified
        acknowledgment             that    specific     suggestions   were    made          and
        subsequently incorporated. If it were to be accepted that seven
        suggestions emanated from the Hon’ble LG and were duly
        incorporated into the policy after discussion, then the deliberative
        process would stand institutionally shared. In that eventuality, any
        allegation that the incorporation of those suggestions formed part of a
        criminal design would logically extend to Sh. Anil Baijal, who was the
        constitutional authority and the Hon’ble LG at the relevant time, and
        to the officers of the LG Secretariat who processed, recorded and
        communicated those inputs.

   275.                     This   Court     refrains    from   making       any     adverse
        observation against the office of the Hon’ble LG. The office is a
        constitutional one, and judicial restraint is both appropriate and
        necessary. However, when the statements of PW-87 and PW-88 are
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                               Page no. 138 of 549
        read conjointly and examined alongside the contemporaneous file
        record, a clear divergence becomes apparent. Both these witnesses
        were senior officers entrusted with the day-to-day functioning of the
        Secretariat and with supervising the movement and processing of
        official files. Their statements are in harmony with the notings
        recorded on the file in the ordinary course of official business. The
        sequence reflected in those notings, endorsement, consideration and
        onward transmission, stands explained by them as part of established
        administrative procedure carried out in discharge of official duty.

   276.                     PW-86, who held the office of the Hon’ble LG at the
        relevant time, has stated a position which does not fully accord with
        the tenor of the official record as elucidated by the officers responsible
        for handling and maintaining the file. The divergence concerns the
        attribution and reflection of certain suggestions in the notings. At this
        juncture, the Court does not propose to enter into a deeper examination
        of that inconsistency. The present exercise is confined to the limited
        scrutiny permissible at the stage of framing of charge. The matter is,
        therefore, left at that, and the Court restricts itself to assessing whether
        the material on record, taken at face value, discloses grounds sufficient
        to proceed.

   277.                     It is therefore not without significance that none of the
        witnesses from the LG Secretariat has alleged fabrication of the
        notings, nor has any plea been taken that the recorded endorsements

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 139 of 549
        were unauthorised or falsely attributed. A categorical admission that
        such suggestions were made and incorporated could potentially
        expose PW-86 to criminal scrutiny under the very theory now
        advanced. In that backdrop, a guarded or qualified denial cannot be
        viewed in isolation from the consequences that a contrary admission
        would entail.

   278.                     Conversely, if the prosecution were to accept that the
        suggestions did, in fact, emanate from the Hon’ble LG and were
        formally incorporated following discussion and approval by the
        Council of Ministers, the foundational premise of unilateral
        manipulation stands fundamentally eroded. The theory of conspiracy,
        predicated upon concealment or misattribution of inputs, cannot
        logically survive if the official record reflects consultation,
        communication and institutional concurrence at the highest executive
        level. The prosecution cannot, on the one hand, rely upon the sanctity
        and authenticity of official records, and on the other, disown the same
        record when it evidences shared deliberation.

                                                                (emphasis supplied)

   279.                   Thus, the matter presents a structural inconsistency in the
        prosecution narrative: either the suggestions were genuinely part of an
        institutional process, in which case the allegation of unilateral criminal
        design loses force; or the official record is to be doubted, in which
        event the prosecution would have to confront the far more serious
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 140 of 549
        implication of institutional falsification, a case neither pleaded nor
        supported by evidence. At the present stage, the contemporaneous
        documentary record, unchallenged in its authenticity, assumes
        primacy and substantially weakens the conspiracy theory as
        projected.

   280.                     At the limited stage of consideration for framing of
        charge, the documentary trail and contemporaneous file notings
        assume primacy. Tested against this record, the defence contention that
        there was transparency, institutional consultation and continuous
        involvement of the LG Secretariat finds substantial support in the
        prosecution’s own witnesses. The material, as it presently stands, does
        not disclose a prima facie case of policy concealment, unilateralism or
        exclusion of the constitutional authority. On the contrary, the record
        reflects a process marked by consultation, communication and
        administrative caution.

   281.                     In the light of the discussion above, the prosecution
        version stands eroded. The contemporaneous record shows that the
        DEP-21/22 was formulated and processed with consultation at the
        highest executive level, including the involvement of the Lieutenant
        Governor’s Secretariat. The file notings record discussions,
        incorporation of inputs, approval by the Council of Ministers and
        subsequent apprisal of the Hon’ble LG.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 141 of 549
   282.                     In these circumstances, a charge of conspiracy founded
        on concealment or unilateral manipulation cannot be sustained against
        A-8 in isolation when the same documentary record reflects
        deliberation and movement of the file through constitutional channels.
        The material indicates institutional participation rather than an
        individualised exercise of authority. It is clarified that this observation
        is not intended to attribute liability to any other authority. The limited
        conclusion, at this stage, is that the record does not disclose prima
        facie material to show that A-8 acted unilaterally or engineered any
        concealed manipulation in the formulation of the policy.

   283.                     Lastly, what renders the entire discussion untenable is
        that the prosecution itself departs from its own foundation. The seven
        suggestions are attributed solely to A-8, yet the record reflects that
        these suggestions were stated to have arisen during deliberations with
        the Hon’ble LG. If A-8 was, as alleged, the sole architect of a draft
        prepared and supplied by the so-called South Group, there was no
        apparent reason for him not to incorporate those very suggestions in
        the draft policy. The prosecution’s position, therefore, lacks internal
        consistency.

   284.                     More importantly, even if the prosecution case is taken
        at its highest, only one out of the seven alleged suggestions is linked
        to any supposed benefit. That suggestion concerns the reduction of the
        turnover requirement for grant of L-1 licence from ₹250 crores per

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 142 of 549
        year for the preceding three years (excluding the Covid year) to ₹150
        crores. According to the prosecution, this reduction enabled M/S
        Indospirit to become eligible for the L-1 licence, which it otherwise
        would not have secured.

   285.                     However, this contention conflicts with the broader
        conspiracy theory advanced by the prosecution itself. It is also alleged
        that the second draft GoM report dated 19.03.2021 was prepared and
        supplied by the South Group. Significantly, the turnover criterion in
        that draft was ₹500 crores per year for the preceding five years, far
        higher than both ₹250 crores and ₹150 crores. The prosecution further
        suggests that this higher threshold was intended to eliminate smaller
        competitors.

   286.                     These two positions cannot stand together. On one hand,
        the South Group is alleged to have proposed a ₹500-crore threshold to
        exclude competition. On the other, the reduction to ₹150 crores is said
        to have been introduced to benefit the same group. Such diametrically
        opposite assertions erode the credibility of the conspiracy theory.

                                                               (emphasis supplied)

   287.                     The record also shows that M/S Indospirit, associated
        with A-7 and projected as the vehicle for alleged recoupment, had
        initially applied for an L-1 licence but withdrew its first application as
        it did not meet even the ₹150-crore eligibility criterion. This fact is of


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 143 of 549
        considerable significance. If the reduction to ₹150 crores had been
        specifically engineered to favour that entity, it is difficult to explain
        why it failed to qualify under the very condition allegedly tailored for
        its benefit.

   288.                     The documentary record therefore indicates that the
        turnover requirement functioned as an objective eligibility condition
        and not as a pre-designed mechanism to secure a predetermined
        outcome. When the prosecution’s own material is read as a whole, it
        reveals clear internal contradictions which materially weaken, indeed,
        demolish, the allegation that the turnover clause was inserted pursuant
        to a pre-conceived conspiracy. Consequently, the prosecution has
        failed to disclose even a prima facie case against A-8 on this aspect.

        (ii) Alleged Suppression of Adverse Legal Opinions by removal of the
        Cabinet Note dated 28.01.2021

   289.                   The prosecution alleges that A-8 deliberately removed an
        office note containing legal opinions which were not in favour of the
        proposed policy. According to the prosecution, those opinions created
        a hurdle because the DEP-21/22 ultimately adopted differed from the
        recommendations made in the Ravi Dhawan Report.

   290.                     The case of the prosecution is that the Ravi Dhawan
        Committee had recommended that wholesale trade should remain with
        a government-controlled entity functioning through a cooperative


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 144 of 549
        structure, and that retail vends should be allotted by lottery. In contrast,
        the DEP-21/22 provided for privatisation of the wholesale segment
        and allocation of retail zones through competitive bidding. It is on this
        basis that the prosecution asserts that the office note containing the
        legal opinions was intentionally removed so that the policy could
        proceed in the desired form.

   291.                   This allegation forms the foundation of the prosecution’s
        case on this issue and will now be examined in the light of the material
        placed on record.

   292.                  The issue assumes importance when para 16.10 and 16.12
        of the First Supplementary Charge-sheet and para 16.5 of the Third
        and Fourth Supplementary Charge-sheets are read in the manner the
        investigating agency has presented them. The prosecution’s case is that
        the “03 legal opinions of Sh. Ranjan Gogoi… Sh. Mukul Rohatgi…
        and Justice KG Balakrishnan…” were “mostly in favour of
        maintaining the status-quo,” and that “after the said Cabinet Meeting
        on 28.01.2021, the accused Manish Sisodia called Sh. Rahul Singh
        and expressed his anger for incorporating the comments of the legal
        experts in the Cabinet Note.” It is further alleged that “these facts
        establish that the accused Manish Sisodia, in criminal conspiracy…
        was working with a pre-conceived idea… and dishonestly and
        deliberately did not put up the cabinet note… and destroyed/cause
        disappearance of the file… because it was not suiting their ulterior

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 145 of 549
        designs,” and that “a vital file containing the opinion of three legal
        experts, which was against his pre-conceived ideas was deliberately
        destroyed by him.”

   293.                     The exact Extracts from the Supplementary Charge-
        Sheets are reproduced herein below for ready reference:-

                cabinet note containing comments of legal experts as annexure
                in the Cabinet meeting dated 28.1.2021 and destroyed/cause
                disappearance of the file of the said Cabinet Note, because it
                was not suiting their ulterior designs.”

        Third & Fourth Supplementary Charge-Sheets

                “16.5…..A vital file containing the opinion of three legal
                experts, which was against his pre-conceived ideas was
                deliberately destroyed by him.”\
   294.                     In substance, the charge-sheet is framed to convey that
        the opinions were “against his pre-conceived ideas,” and that the
        accused removed or destroyed the file to prevent any impediment to
        his alleged design. The language employed, “pre-conceived idea,”
        “criminal conspiracy,” “dishonestly and deliberately,” and “vital
        file… deliberately destroyed”, is clearly directed towards attribution
        of motive and intent, and it is presented in a manner which invites the
        Court to treat the alleged removal of the file as conduct reinforcing the
        broader conspiracy theory.

   295.                  The allegation requires consideration on two aspects.

   296.                   Firstly, it has to be examined whether the legal opinions
        contained in the office note were of such a nature that they could have
        actually obstructed the formulation of the DEP-21/22. A legal opinion,
        by itself, does not automatically prevent a policy decision. It must be
        seen whether the opinion was binding or prohibitory in character, or
        whether it merely expressed reservations or suggested an alternative
        course. Unless the opinion clearly barred the proposed policy
        measures, it cannot be assumed that it stood as an insurmountable
        obstacle.


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 147 of 549
   297.                    Secondly, even if the opinions were adverse to certain
        features of the proposed policy, it must be established that the office
        note was deliberately removed. The allegation of removal cannot rest
        on conjecture. There must be material to indicate conscious and
        intentional suppression. In the absence of such material, no adverse
        inference can be drawn merely on the basis of an alleged
        disappearance.

   298.                    Both these questions require examination on the strength
        of the record.

                 Constitutional Concerns Expressed in the Legal Opinions allegedly
                  to have been concealed

   299.                    Before examining the contents of the legal opinions, it is
        necessary to record that these three opinions were obtained by the
        Alcobev Retail Association and forwarded as suggestions when the
        Ravi Dhawan Report was placed in the public domain for comments.
        They were not opinions sought by the Government in the course of its
        internal decision-making, but were inputs received during the
        consultation process.

   300.                    The fact that these opinions were sent is reflected from
        D-125, which shows the email along with attachments. However, the
        printouts of the legal opinions were not placed on record as standalone
        documents. They are traceable only from the email dump contained in


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 148 of 549
        D-108, which consists of a CD containing more than 14,000 emails.
        At this stage, this Court leaves that aspect open and shall revert to it,
        if required, after examining the report and the surrounding material.

   301.                  For examining whether the opinions were of such a nature
        as to obstruct the proposed policy, it is necessary to go through them
        in their entirety. Any conclusion must rest on a reading of the opinions
        as a whole. They cannot be read in fragments.

   302.                The features now alleged to be the outcome of a conspiracy
        are stated to have been discussed in these opinions. For proper
        appreciation, the relevant extracts are reproduced below so that their
        contents may be assessed in their correct context.

        1. Limiting grant of retail licenses to individuals

        Justice Ranjan Gogoi records: “I am of the opinion that the rationale
        given by the new committee in limiting grant of licenses to only
        individuals - that this would minimize the chances of proxy ownership
        that lead to creation of cartels - would not pass muster of Article 14 of
        the Constitution of India.” (Para 4)

        He further observes: “While avoidance of cartelization and proxy
        ownership is surely a laudable objective, the end to achieve such
        means i.e. limiting grant of licenses to individuals does not appear to
        bear a reasonable or rational nexus with that objective. This would
        violate the doctrine of proportionality…” (Para 5)

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 149 of 549
        Shri Mukul Rohatgi states: “There is no valid reason as to why
        Companies, Partnerships and Co-operative Societies are excluded
        while such entities are permitted to carry any other form of
        business…. There is no restriction on family members obtaining
        license and in fact, any individual can obtain two licenses and further
        transfer / sale of license is permitted.”

        Justice K.G. Balakrishnan adds: “ The combined effect of these
        clauses would mean, for example, that in a family of, say, A, his wife
        B, and one son C and one daughter D, each of A, B,C,D and hold 2
        licenses each and in fact even purchase licenses. Thus, a single family
        could end up having 8 licenses, and none of these may actually be
        obtained from the initial lottery but may be purchases from others who
        may have succeeded in the lottery only based on speculative
        applications. This would in fact be not only lead to cartelization and
        proxy ownership but would also”

        2. Lottery system and Clause 1.3.12 – Permitting transfer of ownership
        (exit option)

        Shri Mukul Rohatgi observes: “Policy of lottery have been proposed.
        The same will lead to complete uncertainty as to who will be
        successful and where. The location of the vend is also not within the
        choice of the applicant.”




CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                    Page no. 150 of 549
        Justice K.G. Balakrishnan notes: “Clause 1.3.12 permits sale of
        interest in the vend obtained through lottery.” and further: “It
        contemplates and grant sort of official recognition to a situation where
        a non-serious applicant with little or no knowledge could actually
        succeed in the lottery and then sell it off to anyone else.”

        Justice Ranjan Gogoi observes: “In fact, the logic of Clause 1.3.12 -
        that permitting transfer of ownership would ‘provide an exit option to
        a non-serious applicant who has little or no knowledge or liquor
        trade - is incongruous…” (Para 8) “…there shall be no limit on the
        number of applications which an individual may make…” (Para 8
        referring to Clause 1.3.4)

        3. Revamping pricing mechanism (letting L1 licensees define the
        MRP)

        Justice K.G. Balakrishnan notes: “After letting the L1 licensee
        decide the MRP, the government would work backwards…” and
        further states that “this would put the select manufacturers in a
        dominant position to decide pricing, would be violative of fair
        competition.”

        Justice Ranjan Gogoi similarly observes: “…competition is being
        reduced to 4 companies only… and then the pricing regime is being
        changed… I am of the opinion that this would put the select
        manufacturers in a dominant position to decide pricing…”

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 151 of 549
   303.                     The record shows that the legal opinions were obtained
        by the Association in the backdrop of the suggestions contained in the
        Ravi Dhawan Report. The proposed clauses, particularly those
        concerning the retail segment, formed the basis on which the opinions
        were sought. The queries were largely confined to issues relating to
        retailers and the manner of allotment of retail vends.

   304.                   A reading of the opinions as a whole shows that they raise
        concerns regarding arbitrariness, absence of rational nexus, possible
        concentration of licences, proxy ownership, cartelisation and
        dominance in pricing. They do not record any categorical objection to
        structural reform, privatisation of wholesale trade, or allocation of
        retail zones through competitive bidding. On the contrary, in relation
        to retail allotment by lottery, the opinions express reservations about
        the lottery framework. None of the experts stated that wholesale must
        remain with a government corporation, nor did they opine that
        privatisation was impermissible.

   305.                   Even if these opinions had been annexed to the Cabinet
        Note, it is difficult to see how they would have created any obstacle.
        The opinions themselves described aspects of the lottery-based model
        as arbitrary and constitutionally vulnerable. Far from hindering a
        change in approach, such observations could have provided a basis for
        reconsidering the suggested framework and for the constitution of a
        GoM to examine the matter further.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 152 of 549
   306.                   In this background, the Court is unable to appreciate how
        the legal opinions could be treated as an impediment to the DEP-21/22
        that was later framed. The prosecution has placed considerable
        emphasis on the Ravi Dhawan Report and on these opinions. However,
        on a plain reading, the principal criticism in the opinions was directed
        against the lottery system for allotment of retail vends. The policy that
        ultimately emerged replaced the lottery system with allocation through
        bidding.

   307.                  Seen in this light, the assertion that the legal opinions stood
        in the way of the policy, particularly the clauses now alleged to
        constitute the core of the supposed modus operandi for recoupment of
        ₹90–100 crores as upfront payment, does not find support in the text
        of the opinions themselves.

              Suppression by Obscurity: Placement of Allegedly Vital Material
                  Within a Voluminous Electronic Record - Conduct of the
                  Investigating Officer and Its Impact on Fair Investigation

   308.                     This Court considers it necessary to resume and clarify
        what was earlier left incomplete regarding the manner in which the
        legal opinions were placed with the charge-sheet.

   309.                     The way in which these opinions have been brought on
        record is of relevance. They have not been filed as separate relied-
        upon documents. What has been formally exhibited is only the first


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 153 of 549
        page of the email forwarded to the official email ID, marked as D-125.
        The actual text of the opinions has not been placed as independent
        annexures. They are traceable only through the email dump marked as
        D-108, which consists of a compact disc containing more than
        fourteen thousand emails.

   310.                     If these opinions were truly regarded as material of
        central importance, they would ordinarily have been placed on record
        distinctly and in a form enabling ready reference. That course was not
        adopted. The contents were not set out separately or highlighted in the
        charge-sheet. During arguments, the opinions did not readily present
        themselves for consideration, as they remained embedded within a
        voluminous electronic record. Their retrieval required sifting through
        the entire email dump rather than referring to a clearly identified
        relied-upon document.

   311.                     In effect, material now described as “vital” was not
        presented in a manner consistent with such characterisation. Instead,
        it remained part of a large pool of electronic data. The manner in which
        it was placed on record assumes significance when the prosecution
        seeks to attach decisive weight to it.

   312.                     At the same time, it is to be fairly recorded that when the
        Court specifically sought the material, and it became difficult to locate
        the opinions within the electronic record, the prosecution did trace and
        furnish copies, thereby enabling scrutiny. That aspect is duly noted.
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 154 of 549
   313.                     However, the manner in which the material was
        originally placed on record requires examination. Even at the cost of
        repetition, it is evident that the charge-sheet places considerable
        emphasis on motive and intent, employing expressions such as “pre-
        conceived            idea,”   “criminal   conspiracy,”   “dishonestly         and
        deliberately,” and “vital file… deliberately destroyed.” Yet the very
        document said to form the basis of such an inference was not distinctly
        presented in a manner that would permit it to be readily examined and
        tested at the same stage.

   314.                     The prosecution case proceeds on the footing that the
        legal opinions were deliberately removed because they were adverse
        and stood in the way of the alleged conspiracy. An allegation of
        deliberate removal of official record, particularly against a person
        holding the office of Deputy Chief Minister (A-8), is of serious
        consequence. If such an allegation is founded upon the contents of
        certain legal opinions, those opinions ought to have been placed before
        the Court clearly and distinctly.

   315.                     Instead, the material remained embedded within a
        voluminous electronic dump. The charge-sheet itself runs into
        thousands of pages and refers to several hundred witnesses. In that
        setting, material not distinctly identified is liable to remain unnoticed
        for a considerable time. The presentation gives the appearance that the
        conclusion is foregrounded, while the supporting material is left to be

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 155 of 549
        discovered only upon deeper scrutiny , almost as if one were searching
        for a needle in a haystack.

   316.                     At this stage, the Court finds itself in a certain dilemma
        as to where the element of “pre-conceived idea” truly lies, whether in
        the conduct attributed to the accused or in the manner in which the
        material has been presented by the investigating officer. The manner
        in which the record has been structured does not sit comfortably with
        the obligation to ensure fairness in the process. A fair trial is a
        fundamental right of every citizen, and the presentation of material
        must reflect that obligation.

                                                                 (emphasis supplied)

   317.                     In view of the foregoing discussion, the allegation of
        suppression of adverse legal opinion does not, prima facie, sustain
        itself on the material presently examined. The contents of the opinions,
        as they stand, do not justify the inference that their alleged non-
        placement or disappearance was actuated by a design to conceal
        binding or prohibitory advice.

   318.                     However, the matter cannot rest there. Since the
        prosecution has attached considerable significance to this allegation
        and seeks to draw a wider inference of motive and conspiracy from it,
        it would be appropriate to examine the relevant witnesses and
        surrounding circumstances so as to have a complete view of the matter.


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 156 of 549
        The       oral      evidence,   the   sequence   of   file   movement,          the
        contemporaneous conduct of officers, and the manner in which
        documents were processed will therefore require scrutiny, before a
        final conclusion is drawn on the evidentiary worth of the allegation.

   319.                     The most significant statement in this regard is that of
        Ashok Daryani (PW-80), who was Assistant Commissioner (Policy)
        during the relevant period and was appointed as the Nodal Officer to
        process the comments received from the public on the Expert
        Committee (Rajeev Dhawan) Report. On a considered appraisal of the
        statement of PW-80, the record reflects that he occupied a pivotal
        administrative position in the formative stage of the DEP-21/22,
        having served in that capacity from mid-December 2020 to
        15.02.2021. His deposition establishes that the consultative exercise
        initiated pursuant to the Dy. CM’s noting dated 16.12.2020 was
        undertaken under clear and detailed ministerial directions, which
        required publication of the Expert Committee Report, invitation of
        comments, issuance of advertisements, creation of a dedicated e-mail
        ID and appointment of a Nodal Officer. PW-80 confirms that “Sh.
        Manish Sisodia, Dy. CM vide noting dated 16.12.2020 directed…”
        these steps and that, in consequence, he was appointed to receive,
        scrutinise and summarise all stakeholder inputs.

   320.                     PW-80 further states that a substantial corpus of
        responses, “14,671 numbers of emails”, was received and examined

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 157 of 549
        through three internal teams. He specifically records that strict
        instructions were already in place “not to mention the names/identity
        of the mail senders as well as the number of persons sending same type
        of comments/suggestions.” This requirement of anonymity constituted
        an important safeguard embedded in the ministerial directions. The
        statement, however, discloses that the draft Cabinet Note prepared on
        27-28.01.2021, at the instance of the then Commissioner Rahul Singh
        and executed through PW-80, departed from these anonymity
        requirements.            PW-80   acknowledges   that   while   summarising
        stakeholder comments, certain suggestions received from the Delhi
        ALCOBEV Retailers Association “along with the opinions of Sh.
        Ranjan Gogoi… Sh. Mukul Rohatgi… and Justice K.G.
        Balakrishnan” were placed as separate annexures, Annexure-C and
        Annexure-D, to the draft Cabinet Note dated 28.01.2021. This
        inclusion, despite express directions to anonymise all inputs, places
        the role of the departmental officers, particularly Rahul Singh and
        PW-80, into sharper focus.

   321.                     Significantly, PW-80 records that the Dy. CM “has taken
        it otherwise that the department has put up the comments of the legal
        experts separately along with the Cabinet Note,” indicating that this
        deviation was viewed adversely at the ministerial level and did not
        emanate from any instruction or desire of the Dy. CM. In this
        backdrop, the preparation of a draft note expressly identifying expert

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 158 of 549
        opinions, contrary to standing directions, emerges as a departmental
        deviation rather than a ministerial act. PW-80 also narrates that the
        draft Cabinet Note was prepared in unusual haste following a late-
        night phone call, with the format forwarded to his WhatsApp and
        approval obtained “in the hospital… as his wife was expecting and
        admitted there.” The file was thereafter taken to the CM’s Camp
        Office, where PW-80 states that the Cabinet “did not consider” the
        note and the file was withheld. This sequence underscores the
        procedural irregularity surrounding the first draft.

   322.                     After Sanjay Goel assumed charge as Commissioner on
        03.02.2021, PW-80 confirms that a revised and structured approach
        was adopted in line with the Dy. CM’s note dated 02.02.2021,
        directing that the Expert Committee Report and the summary of public
        and stakeholder comments be submitted to the Council of Ministers.
        Sanjay Goel (PW-78) instructed the removal of the descriptive
        portions of Annexure-C and Annexure-D and their hard copies,
        clarifying that the material was to be assimilated into the main
        summary and that “no name or identity of any stakeholder/legal expert
        has to be mentioned.” PW-80 explains that the legal opinions were not
        discarded or suppressed; they were retained in substance but
        anonymised and merged into the consolidated summary in accordance
        with the earlier directions proved by PW-78 that “to include all the
        suggestions              and   comments   received   in   the   summary           of

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 159 of 549
        comments/suggestions of general public stakeholders without
        specifying comments received from any corner. Accordingly, the
        dealing hand put up a draft cabinet note on 04.02.2021 along with
        revised summary incorporating all comments/suggestions received.”.
        The final Cabinet Note dated 04.02.2021 thus contained the complete
        inputs, including the legal opinions, presented in conformity with the
        anonymity protocol established on 16.12.2020.

   323.                     The revised note was duly processed through the
        administrative hierarchy, approved by the Dy. CM and the Chief
        Minister on 05.02.2021, and placed before the Cabinet as a tabled
        item, resulting in Cabinet Decision No. 2942 dated 05.02.2021
        constituting a GoM to examine the Expert Committee Report and all
        stakeholder feedback. PW-80 concludes by stating that he was
        transferred w.e.f. 15.02.2021 and was therefore not aware of
        subsequent developments. His statement thus delineates the
        administrative flow and reveals that the only clear deviation from the
        Dy. CM’s directions, particularly on anonymity, occurred at the
        departmental drafting stage under Rahul Singh and PW-80.

   324.                     The statement of PW-82, Pravesh Ranjan Jha, further
        reinforces this position. On a considered evaluation of his evidence,
        no circumstance emerges from which an adverse inference can be
        drawn against the political executive in relation to the preparation,
        approval or placement of the draft note dated 28.01.2021. PW-82

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                     Page no. 160 of 549
        categorically states that although officials of the Excise Department
        approached him around 01:00 PM on 28.01.2021 with a request to
        send an Excise proposal for placement before the Council of
        Ministers, “no matter of Excise Policy was mentioned in the agenda
        for the aforesaid Cabinet Meeting.” He further clarifies that the
        proposal “was not considered by the Council of Ministers on that
        day” and that the file was never returned to him and remains
        untraceable, with both the Chief Minister Office and the Chief
        Minister’s Camp Office certifying that it is not available with them.
        Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that the draft note enclosed
        in the missing file contained formulations not strictly conforming to
        the Dy. CM’s anonymity directions, the record does not establish that
        such a note was ever approved, signed, endorsed or acted upon by the
        Dy. CM or placed before the Cabinet. PW-82’s statement is categorical
        that the proposal was not considered.

   325.                     The consistent position emerging from PW-80 and
        PW-82 is that the substance of all suggestions, including expert legal
        opinions and public inputs, was ultimately collated and incorporated
        in the subsequent Cabinet Note dated 04.02.2021 without omission or
        alteration, thereby negating any allegation of suppression or filtration
        at the ministerial level. Accordingly, the non-traceability of the
        physical file dated 28.01.2021 does not advance the prosecution’s
        case. The draft note never attained the status of a placed, processed or

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                    Page no. 161 of 549
        approved Cabinet document, nor does the evidence disclose any act of
        the Dy. CM conferring legitimacy upon its contents. Once the legal
        opinions and stakeholder inputs stood incorporated in anonymised
        form in the Cabinet Note dated 04.02.2021 and were duly placed
        before the Cabinet, the very premise of suppression or removal ceased
        to survive.

   326.                     Finally, the ancillary allegation that the Dy. CM
        expressed displeasure with certain notings and allegedly “displaced”
        the file also fails to disclose any criminal culpability. The Transaction
        of Business Rules, 1993 (TOBR) prescribe a detailed, institutional
        framework for conduct of governmental business, leaving no scope for
        unilateral derailment of policy-making by an individual Minister. The
        Rules cast a clear duty upon the Secretary concerned to escalate any
        impediment to the Chief Minister and, under Rule 30, to the Hon’ble
        LG. The record is silent on any such escalation, further undermining
        the prosecution narrative.

   327.                     Viewed cumulatively, the material on record does not
        disclose suppression of adverse legal opinions, any deliberate removal
        of material, or any mens rea attributable to the Dy. CM (A-8). At the
        highest, the evidence points to a procedural deviation at the
        departmental             drafting   stage,   subsequently   corrected     through
        institutional processes, which falls far short of meeting the threshold
        required for framing of charge.

        (iii) Assessment of the Alleged 36-Page Draft in Light of the Record
        and its Impact on Fair Trial

   328.               The prosecution has attempted to construct a narrative
        concerning the preparation of the draft GoM report dated 19.03.2021.
        The substance of the allegation is that a set of 36 printed pages was
        generated externally, allegedly by members of the “South Group,” and
        that this very set of 36 pages ultimately travelled through the accused
        persons and became the basis of the second draft GoM report. The
        insinuation is that the draft report was not the result of internal
        deliberation within the Government, but was supplied from outside
        and thereafter formalised within the office of the Dy. CM. The
        allegation thus strikes at the integrity of the policy formulation process
        and seeks to attribute external authorship to the draft itself.

   329.           The charge-sheet relies upon the following extracts:

                “ 16.15 – The investigation further revealed that on 18.03.2021,
                the accused Manish Sisodia, the then Dy. CM, handed over to
                Sh. C. Arvind a hard copy of a draft report of GoM for typing
                and proper formatting. The said draft of GoM report was got
                typed by Sh. C. Arvind on the desktop computer installed at the
                conference room of Dy. CM office with the assistance of his PS
                Sh. Sunil Singhal on two days i.e. 18th & till late night on 19th
                March 2021….
                16.16 ….As per the property of the said 38 pages (including 01
                page label + 01 page index + 36 pages report) word file, it was
                last modified at 10:28 PM on 19.03.2021, which corroborates
                the versions of Sh. C. Arvind and Sh. Sunil Singhal, the
                typist, who have confirmed that the typing work of the draft

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                            Page no. 163 of 549
                GoM report was completed at around 10:30 PM on
                19.03.2021.
                16.18 …….. The said accused persons also used the computer
                kept at the Business Center of Oberoi Hotel and took a photo
                copy of 36 pages from the hotel, which matches (minus the
                index and title pages) with the number of pages of draft of the
                GoM report retrieved from the computer installed in the
                Conference Hall of Dy. CM’s office….”
   330.                     Placed in sequence, these extracts are intended to
        convey that the 36 pages photocopied at the Oberoi Hotel business
        centre were the very same 36 pages (excluding index and title pages)
        that later formed part of the draft GoM report typed in the Dy. CM’s
        office. The similarity in page count is projected as proof of identity.
        The narrative thus suggests a continuous chain, preparation of a 36-
        page document outside the Government office, its movement through
        certain accused persons, its delivery for typing, and its emergence as
        the draft GoM report dated 19.03.2021. The intended inference is that
        the draft report was externally prepared and internally processed.

   331.                     This chain of inference, however, stands contradicted by
        the prosecution’s own witnesses. PW-71, through whom the alleged
        transmission is sought to be established, clearly states: “ I saw that sh.
        Sisodia was present there alongwith sh. Satyendra Jain and Sh.
        Kejriwal in the camp office . In their presence, dy cm sh. Shisodia gave
        me a printed hard copy of a draft report of GoM of about 20-25 pages
        “ and further clarifies that the printed hard copy handed over to him
        by A-8 consisted of “about 20–25 pages.” This is a categorical
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 164 of 549
        assertion regarding the volume of the document allegedly received by
        him at the camp office. The same is reflected in his statement recorded
        under Section 164 of Cr.P.C. (D-187). There is no scope in this
        statement for equating the document received by PW-71 with a 36-
        page printout.

   332.                     The position is further supported by PW-72, the
        stenographer who typed the draft report. On a specific query, PW-72
        states that he typed “25–30 pages.” This statement assumes
        significance, as it emanates from the person directly involved in the
        preparation of the draft. If the draft supplied to PW-71 had been a 36-
        page document, there is no explanation as to why both PW-71 and
        PW-72 consistently refer to a substantially smaller document.

   333.                     The documentary record reinforces this conclusion. The
        first draft GoM report dated 15.03.2021 (Ex. D-196) consists of 24
        pages. The subsequent second draft GoM report dated 19.03.2021 (Ex.
        D-195) expands to 38 pages, and the final GoM report (Ex. D-197)
        runs into 49 pages. This progressive increase in volume reflects an
        evolving drafting process. It is inconsistent with the prosecution’s
        theory of a pre-existing 36-page document being merely circulated and
        adopted. The attempt to correlate the 36-page hotel printout with the
        38-page draft dated 19.03.2021 is speculative and unsupported by the
        record.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 165 of 549
   334.                     The allegation, when tested against the record, stands
        substantially undermined by the very content of the second GoM draft
        report. The introduction of the turnover eligibility clause requiring
        ₹500 crores per annum for the preceding five years is wholly
        inconsistent with the prosecution’s theory of a pre-designed
        conspiracy intended to benefit M/S Indospirit.

   335.                     It is a matter of record that such a stringent threshold, if
        applied, would have rendered M/S Indospirit ineligible at the very
        threshold. A requirement of ₹500 crores annual turnover for five
        consecutive years is not a marginal or cosmetic stipulation; it is a
        substantial financial benchmark that effectively excludes entities
        lacking sustained high-value operations. Far from facilitating entry,
        such a clause would have operated as a clear disqualification.

   336.                     Even when the final DEP-21/22 ultimately prescribed a
        significantly reduced criterion of ₹150 crores per annum for the
        preceding three years for the grant of an L-1 licence, the material
        indicates that M/S IMPL still faced difficulty in meeting the
        qualification parameters. If an entity struggled to satisfy a
        comparatively lower eligibility norm, it is inconceivable that a much
        higher threshold of ₹500 crores for five years could have been
        designed to advance its interests.

   337.                     This aspect strikes at the core of the alleged conspiracy.
        The prosecution theory proceeds on the premise that the draft clauses
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                            Page no. 166 of 549
        were tailored to favour specific private entities and to enable
        recoupment of alleged “upfront” payments. However, a clause that
        objectively disqualifies the very entity said to be a beneficiary defeats
        the suggested motive. A conspiratorial design to extend unlawful
        advantage cannot logically coexist with the insertion of an eligibility
        condition that blocks entry altogether.

                                                                   (emphasis supplied)

   338.                     Accordingly, the turnover clause in the second GoM
        draft not only fails to support the allegation of external manipulation
        but, on the contrary, frustrates the very object attributed to the alleged
        conspirators. It renders the theory of deliberate policy tailoring for
        recoupment commercially and logically untenable.

                 Conduct of Investigating officer and Impact on fair investigation

   339.                     The prosecution’s allegation stands in direct conflict with
        the statements of PW-71 and PW-72 and is further contradicted by the
        very documents relied upon by the prosecution. The suggested identity
        between the hotel printout and the GoM draft rests on conjecture,
        selectively emphasising page counts while overlooking the
        contemporaneous record.

   340.                     In conclusion, the allegation that a 36-page draft
        prepared by the South Group was transmitted through A-4 and A-3 to
        A-8 and thereafter handed over to PW-71 is not borne out by the

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                               Page no. 167 of 549
        material on record. On the contrary, it is contradicted by the
        prosecution’s own evidence. The record does not disclose any basis
        for the alleged inference and is insufficient to sustain even a prima
        facie conclusion of external authorship or influence in the formulation
        of the GoM report.

   341.                     Notwithstanding this, the 36-page photocopy has been
        projected as a decisive circumstance. The juxtaposition of paragraphs
        16.15, 16.16 and 16.18 creates an impression of certainty which the
        record does not support. A circumstance that merely indicates that 36
        pages were photocopied at a hotel has been treated as a conclusive link
        in the alleged chain of conspiracy. When inferential coincidences are
        framed as established facts or when an inference unsupported by the
        primary statements and documents is presented with such finality, it
        risks distorting the appreciation of evidence at the threshold stage. A
        fair trial requires a balanced and faithful presentation of material;
        selective emphasis or overstatement of circumstances undermines that
        standard and directly affects the right of the accused to an impartial
        adjudication.

        (iv)Framing of the Excise Policy, Procedural Infraction

   342.                     On a careful and holistic appraisal of the statement of
        PW-74, Shri Arva Gopi Krishna, read alongside the contemporaneous
        documentary record, this Court finds that the framing of the
        DEP-21/22 does not disclose any procedural infraction. The evidence
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 168 of 549
        on record reflects a structured, traceable, and multi-tiered
        administrative process, commencing with pre-existing departmental
        studies, proceeding through the recommendations of the GoM, and
        culminating in successive approvals by the Council of Ministers and
        scrutiny by the Hon’ble LG. Each stage of the process is supported by
        written notings, Cabinet Decisions and formal ministerial directions,
        which were acted upon by the Excise Department in the ordinary
        course of administration. The material placed before the Court thus
        negates any suggestion of unilateralism, opacity or deviation from the
        established procedure, and instead affirms that the Excise Policy was
        framed through a lawful and institutionally compliant decision-making
        process.

   343.                     In his further statement, PW-74 confirms that the Excise
        Department’s role commenced only after the recommendations of the
        GoM had already been approved by the Council of Ministers. He
        categorically states that the Cabinet-note file “has been dealt by me as
        Excise Commissioner, after approval of the recommendations of GoM
        report… by the Council of Ministers vide Cabinet Decision No. 2983
        dated 22.03.2021,” and that only thereafter did the Excise Department
        prepare the draft DEP-21/22 and submit the proposal to the Finance
        Department on 06.04.2021. This statement clearly situates the
        Department’s role within an implementation framework, rather than at
        the stage of originating policy parameters.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 169 of 549
   344.                     The subsequent file movement, as narrated by PW-74,
        reflects structured decision-making across multiple constitutional and
        institutional levels. He records that the Draft Cabinet Note was
        approved by the Deputy Chief Minister on 08.04.2021; the revised
        Cabinet Note was approved by the Council of Ministers on 15.04.2021
        vide Cabinet Decision No. 2994; and the proposal was thereafter
        forwarded to the Hon’ble LG. On 20.05.2021, the Deputy Chief
        Minister noted that the Hon’ble LG had given certain suggestions and
        directed revision of the Cabinet Note accordingly. The revised
        proposal was thereafter approved by the Council of Ministers vide
        Cabinet Decision No. 3003 dated 21.05.2021, following which the file
        was sent to the Excise Department for implementation. This sequence
        evidences layered scrutiny and collective decision-making, wholly
        inconsistent with allegations of unilateral action. A similar pattern of
        documented approvals and oversight emerges in relation to the issue
        of opening liquor vends in non-conforming wards.

   345.                     PW-74 records that on 28.09.2021, the Deputy Chief
        Minister directed that a proposal be put up for in-principle approval of
        the Government for opening liquor vends in wards lacking conforming
        areas. The Cabinet approved this proposal vide Cabinet Decision No.
        3047 dated 05.11.2021, and the Hon’ble LG thereafter approved the
        same subject to requisite approvals from the DDA and the concerned
        MCD. Subsequently, the LG constituted a High-Powered Committee

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                     Page no. 170 of 549
        on 06.12.2021, whose report dated 10.12.2021 noted that conforming
        areas were available in 205 wards and suggested limited adjustments
        for the remaining wards, though ultimately no vends could be opened
        in non-conforming wards. The record thus shows enhanced scrutiny
        and corrective oversight, not procedural impropriety.

   346.                     The manner of implementation through ministerial
        directions is further illustrated by the note dated 03.02.2022, wherein
        the Deputy Chief Minister, having regard to the recommendations of
        the High-Powered Committee and revenue considerations, recorded
        that the only viable option was to allow retail licensees to open
        additional retail vends in conforming wards, with approval of the
        Council of Ministers to be obtained in due course. Pursuant to this
        direction, the Excise Department issued its circular dated 09.02.2022.
        An identical institutional approach is reflected in the grant of Covid-
        period licence-fee relief: although the Department had initially opined
        that such relief was not envisaged in the tender document, the Deputy
        Chief Minister, after calling for and examining sales-impact data,
        directed on 01.02.2022 that pro-rata licence-fee relief be granted,
        which direction was implemented by the Department through its order
        dated 08.02.2022.

   347.                     The extension of the Excise Policy also followed express
        and recorded ministerial directions. PW-74 states that on 28.02.2022
        the Deputy Chief Minister directed that the policy required further

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 171 of 549
        time to stabilise and resolve teething problems, and again on
        20.05.2022 directed that the policy be extended up to 31.07.2022,
        pursuant to which the Excise Department issued the formal order dated
        23.05.2022. These steps further demonstrate that implementation
        consistently followed written directions placed on file and acted upon
        administratively.

   348.                    As regards the pricing structure and the 12% wholesale
        margin, PW-74 clarifies that the policy-prescribed pricing mechanism
        required wholesalers to bear the full landed cost, including EDP,
        Export Pass Fee, Import Pass Fee, freight, handling and insurance
        charges, and that only thereafter was a 12% profit margin added to
        arrive at the wholesale price, with excise duty and VAT payable to the
        Government by the wholesaler. He further explains that his order dated
        28.10.2021 levying 2% CST did not prohibit manufacturers from
        billing wholesalers for freight, insurance and handling charges, and
        that manufacturers never submitted such bills to the Excise
        Department, whose concern was confined to excise duty and VAT.

   349.                     Against this evidentiary backdrop, the allegation that the
        GoM finalised the Excise Policy without any departmental inputs,
        particularly with respect to the 12% margin or the definition of
        “related entities”, does not withstand scrutiny. PW-74’s statement
        establishes only that he personally did not originate the numerical
        margin or the definition of related entities, not that the Department was

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 172 of 549
        excluded from the deliberative process. This inference is further
        dispelled by the statement of PW-71, Shri C. Arvind, who affirms that
        the draft GoM report was internally worked upon with participation of
        CM fellows/researchers and that departmental officers, including Shri
        Ajay Gambhir, provided inputs for rationalisation of licence
        categories. The broader institutional chronology reinforces this
        conclusion. Even prior to the constitution of the GoM, a Committee
        under the chairmanship of the then Excise Commissioner had been
        constituted on 04.09.2020 and had submitted its detailed report on
        13.10.2020. Departmental material, studies and analysis were thus
        already in existence and available for consideration during the GoM
        deliberations.

   350.                     Viewed cumulatively, the very evidence relied upon by
        the prosecution negates its own allegation. The statements of PW-74
        and PW-71 disclose a multi-layered and consultative policy-making
        process, informed by prior departmental work and subjected to
        repeated institutional approvals. The record therefore fails to disclose
        any prima facie basis to infer that the determination of the 12% margin
        or the definition of related entities was tainted by concealment,
        conspiracy or procedural impropriety so as to justify the framing of
        charge.

        (v) Uniform 12% Wholesale Margin under the DEP-21/22



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 173 of 549
   351.                     A careful, cumulative and contextual appreciation of the
        statements of PW-110 (Sh. Kiran Kumar Gurpur, Chief Sales Officer,
        United Breweries Limited), PW-107 (Sh. Hari Ram Khatri, Retail
        Licensee), PW-108 (Sh. Puneet Ahuja, Retail Participant), PW-109
        (Ms. Neha Juneja, State Head, Sales, United Breweries Limited),
        PW-111 (Senior Executive, United Breweries Limited) and PW-112
        (Sh. Prathmesh Mishra, Chief Commercial Officer, M/S DIAGEO,
        United Spirits Limited), when read conjointly with the DEP-21/22,
        establishes a consistent and coherent economic narrative which
        fundamentally undermines the prosecution’s theory that the uniform
        12% wholesale margin was a source of assured profitability or undue
        benefit. The evidence, viewed as a whole, demonstrates that the
        margin was structurally and commercially inadequate, particularly for
        beer and other high-volume, low-value products and, in practice,
        operated as a loss-making margin across the supply chain.

   352.                     The statement of PW-110 forms the economic starting
        point of this analysis. He categorically deposes that although the
        policy prescribed a uniform 12% wholesale margin, it failed to provide
        a separate cost card for beer, despite beer having a markedly different
        and higher cost structure. PW-110 quantifies that the actual cost of
        distributing beer in Delhi was approximately Rs. 108.8 per case,
        whereas the policy-permitted margin translated to only about Rs. 54
        per case. The consequence of this mismatch was inevitable: strict

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 174 of 549
        adherence to the policy margin resulted in a built-in loss for the
        wholesaler. His evidence makes it clear that the margin did not even
        cover basic distribution costs such as freight, handling, insurance,
        breakages, warehousing, credit exposure and working-capital
        financing. Far from conferring any undue enrichment, the 12% margin
        became a source of sustained commercial stress, compelling
        wholesalers merely to seek measures to remain operational. This
        economic unviability at the wholesale level is reinforced by the
        statement of PW-111, who provides a detailed comparison between
        liquor and beer distribution under the policy. He explains that while
        for IMFL and foreign liquor, with landed prices of approximately Rs.
        1500-1600 per case, the 12% margin yielded around Rs. 180-192 per
        case, the landed price of beer was only about Rs. 450 per case,
        resulting in a distributor margin of merely Rs. 54 per case. PW-111
        further explains that beer distribution entails substantially higher
        operational costs than liquor, including specialised warehousing,
        segregation of stock sourced from multiple breweries, larger storage
        space due to seasonality, and additional handling requirements. During
        the policy period, BSPL was compelled to operate three warehouses
        for beer as against one for liquor, significantly escalating costs. He
        quantifies that the cost of operations was approximately Rs. 109 per
        case, almost double the beer margin, and expressly characterises the
        margin as “unrealistic and loss-making.” Unlike earlier policy


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                   Page no. 175 of 549
        regimes, where manufacturers themselves undertook distribution and
        could internally absorb losses against manufacturing profits, the DEP
        2021-22 prohibited manufacturers from distributing directly, leaving
        distributors with no mechanism to offset losses.

   353.                     It is in this economic backdrop that the evidence
        explains the commercial conduct of manufacturers. PW-110 and
        PW-111 both make it clear that the structural defect in the policy
        placed pressure on manufacturers, including United Breweries
        Limited, to enter into compensatory commercial arrangements, such
        as permitting retention of freight, insurance and handling charges or
        extending limited per-case support, not as a matter of profit-sharing or
        favour, but as a bare necessity to keep the distribution chain functional.
        PW-111 specifically explains that recovery of freight, handling and
        insurance charges from BSPL would have rendered beer distribution
        commercially impossible under the already loss-making margin. He
        clarifies that approximately Rs. 13.8 crores accrued to M/S BSPL on
        account of these components purely as a consequence of UBL’s
        decision to ensure continuity of supply in a structurally adverse policy
        environment, and not as any policy-linked or assured benefit.

   354.                     This narrative of economic compulsion is further
        corroborated by the statement of PW-109, who provides a structured
        and documentary explanation for the issuance of incentives, rebates
        and credit notes. She establishes that market schemes were centrally

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 176 of 549
        sanctioned by the manufacturer’s corporate office, budgeted in
        advance, and implemented uniformly on objective parameters such as
        volume           and     market   share,   without   any   retailer-specific
        customisation. She further explains that a special scheme introduced
        in August 2022 was driven solely by the need to liquidate stock in
        anticipation of the policy’s expiry on 31.08.2022, a commercial
        exigency arising from policy uncertainty rather than any embedded
        benefit to wholesalers. PW-109 also clarifies that M/S BSPL, as
        distributor, merely operationalised these manufacturer-approved
        schemes, and that any unilateral deviation, such as advance issuance
        of a credit note, was unauthorised and driven by recovery concerns
        when a retailer was exiting the business.

   355.                     The statements from the retail end complete the picture
        of a stressed commercial ecosystem. PW-107, a retail licensee,
        candidly acknowledges that retail operations under the DEP-21/22
        were themselves commercially onerous and often loss-making,
        necessitating post-sale adjustments through credit notes and rebates
        merely to sustain operations. His evidence reflects a market
        characterised by continuous liquidity pressure rather than assured
        profitability. PW-108 corroborates this position by unequivocally
        denying any cash dealings or illegal payments and placing rebates and
        adjustments squarely within the realm of ordinary commercial
        accounting. His statement is conspicuously silent on any demand,

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 177 of 549
        offer or transmission of illicit consideration and instead reflects the
        practical necessity of such adjustments in a struggling market.

   356.                     The evidence of PW-112 further reinforces that the
        impugned commercial conduct was driven by operational necessity
        and competitive pressures, not by any corrupt design. He explains that
        upon the coming into force of the new policy, there existed genuine
        commercial ambiguity regarding the treatment of insurance, freight
        and handling charges, which historically accrued to the L-1
        wholesaler. To ensure that supplies commenced without disruption, a
        senior-level commercial discussion on 10.11.2021 led to a conscious
        decision not to insist upon recovery of these components from M/S
        BSPL Sales Pvt. Ltd. PW-112 expressly records that this was a
        commercial decision taken to ensure immediate commencement of
        invoicing and continuity of supply. He further clarifies that prevailing
        market realities and competitive considerations, including the
        apprehension that M/S BSPL might exit the distributorship, also
        informed this decision, underscoring that the continuation of the
        wholesale relationship was guided by ordinary commercial prudence
        in a newly restructured and economically strained market.

   357.                Taken together, the statements of PW-110, PW-107, PW-108,
        PW-109, PW-111 and PW-112 present a consistent, industry-wide
        narrative. The uniform 12% wholesale margin under the DEP-21/22
        was economically unviable, particularly for beer, and resulted in loss-

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                     Page no. 178 of 549
        absorbing operations rather than surplus profitability. Manufacturers
        and distributors were compelled to adopt compensatory commercial
        mechanisms, rebates, credit notes and absorption of logistics costs,
        purely to keep the supply chain functional. The evidence uniformly
        depicts a stressed, survival-driven market rather than a rent-seeking
        arrangement. At the stage of consideration of charge, in the face of this
        unimpeached and internally consistent evidence led by the
        prosecution’s own witnesses, the assertion advanced by the
        prosecution that the flat 12% wholesale margin on the landed price of
        IMFL, beer and wine yielded “huge profits” to wholesalers is exposed
        as demonstrably erroneous, economically illiterate and legally
        unsustainable.

   358.                 The material relied upon by the prosecution not only fails to
        substantiate this allegation but affirmatively disproves it. The evidence
        establishes that the uniform application of a 12% margin, particularly
        to beer and high-volume products, resulted in a structural mismatch
        between revenue and cost, producing losses rather than surplus. The
        prosecution has neither identified any admissible material showing
        actual profit accrual nor demonstrated, even prima facie, that the
        margin translated into excess gains capable of being appropriated as
        illegal gratification. To persist with such an allegation in the teeth of
        categorical statement explaining cost structures, losses and survival-
        driven commercial adjustments is to substitute conjecture for

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 179 of 549
        evidence. The prosecution’s theory, resting on a superficial
        arithmetical assumption divorced from economic reality, thus
        collapses at the threshold and cannot, in law, sustain an inference of
        undue benefit, quid pro quo or corrupt intent.

   359.                    Even otherwise the increase in wholesale margin from 5%
        to 12% has to be viewed in the backdrop of a fundamentally altered
        distribution framework and the substantial escalation in operational
        and logistical responsibilities cast upon L-1 licensees.

   360.                     Under      the   earlier   policy   regime,    manufacturers
        themselves held L-1 licences and exercised end-to-end control over
        storage, transportation, and distribution. The costs of warehousing,
        logistics,         handling,     breakages,     compliance,       and    inventory
        management were embedded within an integrated manufacturer-led
        system. The DEP-21/22 dismantled this structure and introduced an
        independent wholesaler as a distinct intermediary, entrusted with
        extensive statutory and operational obligations expressly enumerated
        in clause 3.1.11 (vii) of the DEP-21/22. These included establishment
        and maintenance of compliant warehouses, deployment of logistics
        infrastructure, handling and transfer of liquor bottles, adherence to
        stricter regulatory standards, and assumption of risks earlier borne by
        manufacturers.

                                                                   (emphasis supplied)


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                              Page no. 180 of 549
   361.                     Any new entrant into a distribution business of this scale
        is necessarily required to incur significant upfront expenditure to
        create infrastructure, manpower, logistics chains, and compliance
        systems in conformity with the new policy framework. Such costs are
        neither incidental nor avoidable; they are intrinsic to the redesigned
        model. A policy that brings about a complete systemic shift cannot be
        expected to function effectively without addressing the economic
        realities of the new responsibilities it creates. Significant structural
        change, by its very nature, demands corresponding economic
        recalibration.

   362.                     At this juncture, it bears emphasis that the enhancement
        of the wholesale margin to 12% cannot, in any manner, be construed
        as a facet of any alleged conspiracy. As already discussed, and as borne
        out from the evidence on record, the uniform 12% margin was, in fact,
        economically unviable, particularly in the case of beer and wine,
        where the costs of storage, handling, refrigeration, transportation,
        breakages and higher volume-to-value ratios rendered the margin not
        merely inadequate but onerous for wholesalers. If the enhancement of
        margin were the outcome of a carefully orchestrated conspiratorial
        design or a policy tweak at the behest of the so-called “South Group”,
        it defies logic as to why such a margin structure would be retained
        uniformly even for beer and wine, where it resulted in sustained losses
        rather than assured profitability. The very fact that the margin failed to

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 181 of 549
        yield commercial viability across categories militates against the
        theory of any tailor-made or conspiratorial benefit.

                                                               (emphasis supplied)

   363.                     The prosecution case, when examined in the context of
        the statutory scheme, discloses a basic inconsistency. It proceeds on
        the premise that a wholesaler, out of the notified 12% margin, would
        agree to part with 6% as an “upfront” payment and yet continue to
        operate viably under the same regime. On its own showing, this would
        reduce the effective margin by half even before accounting for
        infrastructure costs, routine operational expenses, compliance
        requirements and market risks.

   364.                     This premise becomes even more questionable when the
        structure of the DEP-21/22 is kept in view. Under the earlier regime,
        the system was manufacturer-led. The DEP-21/22 altered that
        arrangement and introduced an independent wholesaler as a separate
        intermediary, entrusted with defined statutory and operational
        responsibilities under Clause 3.1.11 (vii).

   365.                     These responsibilities were substantial. The wholesaler
        was required to establish and maintain compliant warehouses, develop
        logistics infrastructure, handle and transfer consignments, adhere to
        stricter regulatory standards, and assume risks that were earlier borne
        by manufacturers. The financial burden attached to these obligations


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 182 of 549
        was considerable. Warehousing expenses, manpower, transportation,
        insurance, regulatory liabilities, and even the setting up of facilities for
        testing and checking spurious liquor at the warehouse level formed
        part of the operational framework. The 12% margin, therefore, was not
        an unencumbered surplus but a return structured against these
        commitments.

   366.                     In this backdrop, the suggestion that a wholesaler would
        voluntarily surrender half of its assured margin at the outset and
        thereafter operate under significant financial and regulatory
        obligations, without any demonstrable compensating advantage, does
        not accord with ordinary commercial conduct. In allegations of
        financial conspiracy, the element of gain is fundamental. There must
        be a reasonable and discernible expectation of profit. Where the
        structure described leaves little scope for viable return and instead
        renders the business economically strained, the theory of conspiracy,
        as projected, appears internally flawed and inconsistent with the very
        objective it is said to achieve.

   367.                     The enhancement of the wholesale margin must also be
        seen in conjunction with the introduction of provisions such as the
        EDP (Ex-Distillery Price) clauses, which were designed to ensure that
        efficiencies and competitive pricing ultimately benefit the consumer.
        The object was not merely to alter margins but to create a sustainable



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 183 of 549
        and transparent supply chain capable of functioning independently of
        manufacturer dominance.

   368.                     Significantly,      the    investigating    agency      has       not
        undertaken any comparative analysis between the old and the new
        policy frameworks to contextualise the increase in the wholesale
        margin.           Without examining the qualitative and quantitative
        differences in obligations, cost structures, and risk allocation between
        the two regimes, any assertion that the revised margin is excessive
        remains conclusory.

                                                                       (emphasis supplied)

   369.                     Viewed thus, the increase in wholesale margin
        represents a policy response to a transformed regulatory and
        commercial               environment.    The     introduction     of   independent
        wholesalers, who were entirely absent in the earlier system, inevitably
        entailed costs that could not be sustainably absorbed without a
        corresponding adjustment in margins. In the absence of such
        adjustment, the new distribution model itself would have been
        rendered economically unviable.

        (vi) Purported Sponsorship and Orchestration of Public-Consultation
        Emails on the Ravi Dhawan Report

   370.                     The allegation against A-8 is that he orchestrated certain
        emails purportedly sent in support of specific clauses which, according

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                                 Page no. 184 of 549
        to the prosecution, were intended to benefit the so-called “South
        Group.” It is alleged that when the Ravi Dhawan Committee Report
        was placed in the public domain and comments were invited from the
        public, certain emails received during that consultative process were
        sponsored rather than independent expressions of opinion.

   371.                     At the threshold, the Court is guided by the settled
        parameters governing the stage of framing of charge. The prosecution
        material, if taken at face value, must disclose a prima facie case against
        the accused. In a situation where two views are possible from the
        material relied upon by the prosecution, the prosecution must
        demonstrate that the material gives rise to grave suspicion. The
        opinion of the Court must rest strictly on the case as projected by the
        prosecution and not on conjectural amplification.

   372.                     On the prosecution’s own showing, out of more than
        fourteen thousand emails received in response to the public notice
        inviting comments on the Ravi Dhawan Committee Report, six emails
        are alleged to have been sponsored. Even if this assertion is accepted
        in its entirety for present purposes, the proportion and context are
        material. The consultative process was open and voluminous. The
        allegation, as framed, does not demonstrate that the process stood
        vitiated in substance or that the policy outcome was shaped, dictated,
        or materially influenced by these six communications.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 185 of 549
   373.                     It is important to note that the distinction between
        suspicion and grave suspicion may, in an appropriate case, arise even
        at the level of the allegation itself. An allegation, taken at its highest
        and presumed to be true, may still yield two possible inferences, one
        suggestive of impropriety and the other indicative of a circumstance
        too slender to sustain a criminal charge. Where the allegation, on its
        own terms, discloses no more than an isolated or peripheral feature in
        a large consultative exercise, its acceptance does not automatically
        elevate it to the level of grave suspicion.

   374.                     To attribute criminal design to an entire policy
        framework on the basis of six emails out of more than fourteen
        thousand emails is akin to attempting to pierce an elephant with a
        needle, the scale of the allegation is wholly disproportionate to the
        magnitude of the inference sought to be drawn. A circumstance which,
        even if assumed to be correct, carries no inherent gravity cannot be
        enlarged into grave suspicion merely by the seriousness of the
        conclusion sought to be attached to it. Thus, where the allegation
        itself admits of dual inferences and, even when presumed to be true,
        remains a minor or inconsequential circumstance within the broader
        consultative process, the statutory threshold for framing of charge is
        not satisfied. Even so, it would not be appropriate to discard the
        allegation in its entirety at this stage; the Court must proceed to
        examine the material placed by the prosecution in support of this

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 186 of 549
        allegation to ascertain whether, upon closer scrutiny, it discloses any
        substantive nexus warranting further consideration.

   375.                     A holistic examination of the statements of PW-92
        (Zakir Khan), PW-93 (Kartikey Azad), PW-94 (Kartikey Raja), PW-95
        (Daksh Wadhwa) and PW-99 (Pulkit Bisht) reveals a uniform thread
        that significantly weakens the prosecution’s allegation of a sponsored,
        orchestrated or coordinated attempt to sway the public-consultation
        process on the Expert Committee (Ravi Dhawan) Report. PW-92, the
        then Chairperson of the Delhi Minorities Commission, makes it
        abundantly clear that he neither understood nor examined the Ravi
        Dhawan Report, had no familiarity with the Excise Policy, and did not
        even read the handwritten note later mentioned in statement. His
        interaction with the Dy. Chief Minister, as per his own account, took
        place in the context of the Commission’s financial requirements;
        during that routine meeting he was simply advised to visit the Excise
        Department’s website and submit suggestions to the official email ID
        notified for public comments.

   376.                     Nothing in his statement suggests that the A-8 dictated,
        influenced or approved any particular content, nor does PW-92
        attribute any form of sponsorship or direction to him. On the contrary,
        the broader record reflects an explicit instruction within the
        Government to keep public-consultation emails anonymous, which
        runs counter to the allegation that the A-8 sought orchestrated

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 187 of 549
        responses. The internal administrative context is clarified by PW-93,
        who states that the Ravi Dhawan Report was circulated to him on
        12.01.2021 with a direction to analyse it from a legal perspective. Two
        days later, a brief written note identifying certain themes or points was
        handed over to facilitate the interns’ study of the report. Significantly,
        PW-92 himself admits that he did not read this note. The note,
        therefore, does not indicate pre-drafted or politically motivated
        content; rather, it reflects an attempt within the Commission to
        familiarise junior staff with the subject-matter on which public
        comments were invited. PW-93’s statement demonstrates that the
        exercise was internally generated, informal and academic in character,
        consistent with the training objectives associated with internships.

   377.                     PW-94’s evidence, when read alongside the material
        collected by the investigating agency, further exposes the fragility of
        the prosecution’s suggestion that a group of interns sent multiple
        emails in an organised manner. PW-94 recalls a general instruction
        from PW-92 that they should send “as many emails as possible,” and
        mentions that ten to twelve interns were in the WhatsApp group, with
        some possessing multiple email accounts. Yet, the CBI investigation
        could trace only six emails originating from this group. This stark
        disparity between the alleged instruction and the actual number of
        emails sent demonstrates the absence of any large-scale or impactful
        campaign. Against the backdrop of more than 14,000 emails received

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 188 of 549
        by the Excise Department pursuant to the public notice, these six
        emails stand as numerically insignificant and devoid of any capacity
        to influence or alter the outcome of a broad-based consultation.

   378.                     The alleged scale of email activity is disproved by
        recovered evidence; the supposed sponsorship stands contradicted by
        PW-92’s own ignorance of the subject-matter; and the participation of
        interns underscores transparency rather than covert mobilisation.
        Thus, the prosecution’s theory rests not on admissible material, but on
        layered assumptions: first, that an untraceable and unread note
        constituted a directive; second, that such a note translated into
        sponsored content; and third, that six anonymous emails could
        meaningfully affect a consultation process involving thousands of
        responses. Each of these assumptions stands contradicted by the
        prosecution’s own witnesses. In essence, the consolidated statements
        of PW-92 through PW-99 establish that the Delhi Minorities
        Commission merely undertook an internal review of the Expert
        Committee Report and submitted a handful of comments through the
        same channel available to all.

        (vii) Destruction of mobile phone

   379.                     At the stage of consideration of charge, this Court is
        required to examine whether the material placed on record discloses a
        prima facie case attracting the ingredients of the offence alleged.
        Tested on this settled parameter, the allegation that the then Deputy
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 189 of 549
        Chief Minister (A-8) caused the destruction of his earlier mobile phone
        so that no incriminating material may be found against him does not,
        in the opinion of this Court, satisfy the statutory requirements of
        Section 201 of the IPC. Section 201 IPC contemplates a deliberate act
        of causing disappearance of evidence of an offence, with the
        knowledge or reason to believe that such offence has been committed,
        and with the intention of screening the offender from legal
        punishment. Thus, even at the threshold, the prosecution is required to
        place material showing: (i) the existence of evidence relating to a
        specific offence; (ii) knowledge thereof on the part of the accused; and
        (iii) a conscious act of destruction undertaken with the requisite intent
        to screen oneself or another from punishment.

   380.                     In the present case, the prosecution allegation proceeds
        on the premise that the accused caused the destruction of his mobile
        phone to ensure that no incriminating material could be recovered
        against him. However, the record is conspicuously silent as to what
        incriminating material is alleged to have existed on the said device. No
        specific message, call, document, or digital communication has been
        identified as having been generated, transmitted, or stored on the
        phone which could be said, even prima facie, to constitute evidence of
        the alleged offence. The prosecution thus invites the Court to presume
        the existence of incriminating material solely on the basis of the



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 190 of 549
        alleged destruction of the device. Such an approach is legally
        impermissible.

                                                               (emphasis supplied)

   381.                     At the stage of framing of charge, suspicion may suffice,
        but the suspicion must be founded on material placed on record, and
        not on conjecture or reverse inference. The mere allegation that a
        device was destroyed to prevent recovery of incriminating material
        cannot substitute for the foundational requirement. Section 201 IPC
        does not criminalise the act of ensuring absence of evidence in the
        abstract; it penalises the deliberate disappearance of existing evidence
        of an offence, accompanied by the requisite mens rea. It is also
        relevant to note that a simpliciter change of a mobile handset, followed
        by disposal or destruction of the earlier device, is not per se
        unlawful.

   382.                     In the absence of material suggesting that the device
        contained incriminating data, such conduct cannot be elevated to an
        inference of culpable intent. Crucially, the prosecution has not placed
        any material to show that the accused acted with the intention of
        screening himself from legal punishment by causing disappearance of
        specific evidence. The essential element of mens rea under Section
        201 IPC thus remains unsubstantiated. To permit the charge to proceed
        on the basis of a presumed existence of incriminating material would


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 191 of 549
        amount to converting suspicion into admissible material, which the
        law does not countenance even at the stage of charge.

   383.                     In these circumstances, this Court is of the considered
        view that the allegation relating to destruction of the mobile phone, as
        framed, does not disclose the essential ingredients of an offence under
        Section 201 IPC. The material on record falls short of establishing a
        prima facie case, and the invocation of Section 201 IPC on this count
        cannot be sustained at the stage of framing of charge.

        (C) Final analysis qua A-8

   384.                     Having examined each allegation independently and
        cumulatively, this Court finds that the prosecution case, as projected,
        does not survive judicial scrutiny at the threshold stage.

   385.                     The fixation of the 12% wholesale margin, the structural
        decision to privatise the wholesale trade, the zoning of retail vends,
        and the formulation of the “related entities” clause have all been
        examined in the light of the Ravi Dhawan Committee Report, the
        successive draft GoM reports dated 15.03.2021, 19.03.2021 and final
        GoM report dated 22.03.2021, the Minutes of deliberations dated
        05.04.2021, the Cabinet approvals, and the contemporaneous file
        notings. When these documents are read sequentially and in
        conjunction with the statements of the relevant witnesses, what
        emerges is a process of policy evolution marked by structured


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 192 of 549
        deliberation and administrative refinement. The record reflects
        continuity, consultation and institutional engagement. None of these
        clauses, whether viewed individually or collectively, discloses a
        departure so abrupt or unexplained as to justify an inference of
        criminal intent. Policy choices, even if debatable or subsequently
        reconsidered, cannot be equated with criminal conspiracy in the
        absence of material demonstrating quid pro quo, concealment or
        corrupt inducement.

   386.                     The theory of overarching conspiracy similarly fails to
        find support in the material placed before the Court. There is no
        evidence placing A-8 in any clandestine meeting or conspiratorial
        assembly. No witness has stated to his participation in any secret
        deliberation for unlawful gain. No admissible material demonstrates
        his involvement in any alleged cash transaction. The prosecution has
        not produced a single recovery, document or financial trail linking him
        with the alleged transfer of funds. The allegation of monetary
        exchange remains unsubstantiated so far as he is concerned.

   387.                     The attempt to connect A-8 with the alleged money
        movement is sought to be routed through A-3. However, there is no
        legally admissible material to establish that A-3 acted as a conduit for
        A-8. The relationship between them is inferred rather than
        demonstrated. The link sought to be drawn between A-8 and the



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 193 of 549
        alleged acts of A-3 rests on conjecture and assumption rather than
        demonstrable nexus.

   388.                     More fundamentally, the prosecution narrative suffers
        from an internal contradiction that strikes at the root of the conspiracy
        theory. The contemporaneous documentary record establishes that the
        formulation and processing of the DEP-21/22 involved consultation at
        the highest executive level. The file notings record discussions with
        the Hon’ble LG, incorporation of suggestions, approval by the Council
        of Ministers, and subsequent apprisal of the Hon’ble LG. The material
        shows institutional participation of the LG Secretariat in scrutiny and
        movement of the file. It further reflects that the policy was neither
        concealed nor processed in isolation, but travelled through recognised
        constitutional channels.

   389.                     In such a scenario, the theory of conspiracy cannot
        selectively survive against one constitutional authority while being
        rendered inapplicable to another on the basis of the very same material.
        A charge of unilateral manipulation cannot logically and legally be
        sustained against the Deputy Chief Minister (A-8) alone when the
        documentary chain demonstrates deliberation, consultation and
        processing through the office of the Hon’ble LG. The same notings
        cannot, in law, exonerate one authority while simultaneously
        incriminating another, when both are reflected in the same institutional
        record.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 194 of 549
                                                              (emphasis supplied)

   390.                     The record also shows that during the relevant period,
        the power of transfer of officers, including the Excise Commissioner,
        vested with the competent constitutional authority and was exercised
        on multiple occasions. This underscores the fact that the administrative
        framework was neither static nor subordinate to a single individual.
        The Hon’ble LG and the senior officers of the LG Secretariat were
        integral to the movement and scrutiny of the file. If the prosecution
        case were to be taken to its logical conclusion on the premise of
        manipulation in policy formulation, it would inevitably extend to those
        very authorities who processed, examined and apprised themselves of
        the policy. Yet no such allegation is pressed.

   391.                     This observation does not imply that any other
        constitutional functionary ought to have been arraigned as an accused.
        On the contrary, the contemporaneous record, when objectively
        examined, discloses no unilateral manipulation by A-8. The material
        reveals a process marked by consultation, communication and
        administrative engagement at multiple levels. Once it is shown that the
        policy travelled through established constitutional channels and was
        processed in accordance with the Transaction of Business Rules, the
        foundation of a selective conspiracy allegation collapses.

   392.                     The cumulative assessment, therefore, is unambiguous.
        The structural features of the policy do not disclose criminal intent.
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 195 of 549
        The alleged conspiracy lacks demonstrable agreement or meeting of
        minds. There is no material placing A-8 in conspiratorial meetings.
        There is no substantiated financial trail linking him to any cash
        transfer. There is no admissible evidence that A-3 acted as his conduit.
        The documentary record reflects institutional deliberation rather than
        clandestine orchestration.

   393.                     On the material as it presently stands, the prosecution
        has failed to establish even a prima facie case against A-8. The
        allegations, when tested against the contemporaneous record and the
        statements of the prosecution’s own witnesses, do not generate grave
        suspicion warranting trial. The edifice of conspiracy, built upon
        inference and selective reading of the record, stands dismantled when
        the documents are read as a whole.

        Allegations against A-1 and A-2

   394.                     The prosecution alleges that A-1, Kuldeep Singh, then
        Deputy Commissioner (IMFL), and A-2, Narender Singh, then
        Assistant Commissioner (IMFL), Excise Department, GNCTD, acted
        in concert with private accused persons, including accused Vijay Nair
        and A-7 Sameer Mahendru, to facilitate the grant of an L-1 wholesale
        licence to M/S Indospirits by bypassing the statutory scheme and
        policy safeguards governing excise licensing. It is alleged that upon
        receipt of a complaint dated 18.10.2021 alleging cross-funding and
        cartelisation involving M/S Indospirits and M/S KGRL, A-1 directed
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 196 of 549
        that material allegations relating to EMD funding and common
        financial interest not be incorporated in the show-cause notice and that
        no effective enquiry be undertaken.

   395.                     It is further alleged that when a second L-1 application
        dated 29.10.2021 was filed, despite patent deficiencies and the
        pendency of related proceedings before the Hon’ble Supreme Court,
        A-1 and A-2 ensured that the application was processed and approved
        on 05.11.2021 in undue haste. According to the prosecution, A-2
        restrained the dealing staff from issuing the proposed deficiency
        memo, assured that he would personally procure the requisite
        documents, and caused such documents to be placed in the official file
        on 05.11.2021 without any covering letter, diarisation or proper
        receipt, following which the licence was approved with the
        concurrence of A-1.

   396.                     The prosecution further alleges that A-2 received illegal
        gratification of Rs. 30 lakhs from accused Sameer Mahendru (A-7),
        through the coordination of approver Dinesh Arora (PW-20) and at the
        instance of Accused Vijay Nair (A-3), as consideration for expediting
        and securing the L-1 licence in favour of M/S Indospirits. It is alleged
        that A-1, by his acts and omissions, abused his official position to
        extend undue favour to M/S Indospirits in furtherance of the aforesaid
        arrangement. On the basis of these allegations, the prosecution asserts



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 197 of 549
        that A-1 and A-2 are liable for offences punishable under Section 120-
        B of the IPC read with Sections 7, 7A and 8 of the PC Act, 1988.

        Analysis

        File Movement and Alleged Procedural Irregularity

   397.                     The earlier excise policy was characterised by
        manufacture-controlled wholesale and retail operations as pointed by
        Ravi Dhawan report, whereas DEP-21/22 envisaged a complete
        transition to a system anchored in private wholesalers and private
        retailers operating under a newly introduced licensing regime. This re-
        engineering of the supply chain, from manufacturers to consumers,
        necessarily required the issuance of fresh licences, onboarding of new
        entities, realignment of logistics, and readiness across multiple tiers of
        administration.

   398.                     It is also of material significance that the DEP-21/22
        was scheduled to come into force on 17.11.2021, leaving a narrowly
        circumscribed time window for its operationalisation. The limited
        interregnum between notification and implementation inevitably
        required prompt administrative action to ensure that the new
        framework became functional on the appointed date, without
        disruption of supply or breakdown of lawful trade.

   399.                     Viewed in this backdrop, the expeditious movement of
        files or processing of licence applications cannot be examined in

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 198 of 549
        isolation. Any such assessment must account for the scale of the
        transition mandated by the policy, the impending date of
        implementation, and the administrative imperative of continuity. The
        contextual foundation thus established is essential before evaluating
        any allegation of undue haste or impropriety.

        One day clearance of file for the grant of L-1 Licence

   400.                     The allegation of undue favour on account of one-day
        clearance of the L-1 licence is neutralised when examined in the
        undisputed context of the time-bound implementation of the
        DEP-21/22. As brought on record through Ashok Kumar (PW-7,
        Section Officer, Policy, Delhi Excise Department) and the
        contemporaneous documentary material (D-150 and D-153), retail
        sale under the DEP-21/22 was scheduled to commence from
        17.11.2021, and the old and new regimes could not operate
        simultaneously beyond the transition window. The Transition Report
        (D-153) records that a Committee was constituted “for preparing a
        transition policy,” that the transition was to be carried out “in a smooth
        and time bound manner,” and that parallel running was “bleak due to
        technical reasons” and “does not appear to be feasible,” necessitating
        a clean cut-off with advance timelines. The report further records
        uniform schedules, procedural safeguards, and the requirement of
        approximately 60 days for label approval and inventory build-up.

   401.                     Read in this backdrop, the statement of PW-7 assumes
        significance. PW-7 places on record that out of thirteen L-1 licences
        granted, the file of M/S Gautam Wines Private Limited was cleared
        within a single day on 11.11.2021, that three entities were granted
        licences on the very same day as M/S Indospirits, and that licences
        were granted even on 03.11.2021, which goes against the stand of
        prosecution that it was a non working day. The urgency in processing
        licences in early November 2021 thus stands fully explained by policy
        compulsion and technical constraints, rendering the prosecution’s
        attempt to isolate the case of M/S Indospirits wholly unsustainable.

   402.                     The internal movement of the file is further clarified by
        the conjoint statements of PW-18 (Smt. Suman), the Section Officer
        handling IMFL matters, and PW-19 (Sachin Solanki), the dealing
        assistant. Read together, they present a consistent and coherent
        account demonstrating that the processing of the L-1 licence followed
        the established departmental structure and ordinary administrative
        practice.

   403.                     PW-18 consistently states that the processing of the first
        L-1 application dated 09.09.2021, the handling of the cartelisation
        complaint, the withdrawal of that application, and the scrutiny of the
        fresh application dated 29.10.2021 all occurred within the ordinary
        departmental framework. She records that “successive deficiency
        memos were issued after line-by-line examination,” and explains

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 200 of 549
        routine office practice by stating that “at time of work pressure, peon
        directly gives the letters/dak to the concerned dealing assistants as per
        direction of senior officers.” She identifies her own signatures and
        those of the dealing assistant, Assistant Commissioner and Deputy
        Commissioner on the notesheets, thereby confirming supervisory
        scrutiny at every stage.

   404.                     PW-19 fully corroborates this account and sharply
        circumscribes his role, stating that “my duty is to put the
        documents/applications… in the form of noting.”            He confirms
        working under PW-18’s supervision and details issuance of deficiency
        memos dated 28.09.2021, 14.10.2021 and thereafter, all after approval
        of superior officers. In relation to the cartelisation complaint, he
        deposes that he was instructed “to put up only the issues related to L-1
        application,” and confirms that “Sh. Narender Singh… deleted the
        point No. c and last line in point No. e.” Most significantly, he states
        that the decisive recommendation note in the fresh application was
        settled by the Deputy Commissioner himself: “Sh. Kuldeep Singh, DC
        inserted in the said note the portion of the complaint which he
        considered fit… in his handwriting,” after which PW-19 merely typed
        the note and signed as instructed. He further confirms that the
        undertakings of Sameer and Geetika Mahendru “were not placed in
        the file” at the relevant time and “might have been taken and placed…
        by Sh. Narender Singh, AC or Sh. Kuldeep Singh, DC.”

   405.                     The chronology surrounding the first L-1 application
        dated 09.09.2021, its subsequent withdrawal, and the later grant of
        licence to M/S Indospirit is of material relevance while examining the
        prosecution’s allegation of conspiracy and recoupment. The initial
        application was moved in the name of IMPL (Joint Venture partnership
        firm) with Indospirit Distribution Limited and Indospirit Marketing
        Pvt. Ltd. as its constituent partners. The same is evident from the
        contents of the application form dated 09.09.2021 as well as the
        undertaking dated 25.08.2021. The relevant extract of application
        form and undertaking thereof is reproduced below for the sake of
        ready reference:

                “….3) That in case of joint venture firm:

                 Misleading Projection of Record by the Investigating Officer an impact on
                  fair trial

   406.                     At this stage, it also becomes necessary to juxtapose
        paragraph 16.20 of the charge-sheet with the contemporaneous
        document forming its basis. Paragraph 16.20 reads as under:

                 “16.20 The investigation revealed that as per joint venture
                 agreement submitted by M/S Indospirit Marketing Pvt Ltd, in
                 pursuance to its application dated 09.09.2021 for grant of L1
                 license, the partners were M/S Indospirit Distribution Ltd
                 (35%), Shri Buchi Babu (16.25%), Shri Prem Rahul Manduri
                 (32.5%) and Shri A.R. Pillai (16.25%). As per ROC records,
                 Sh. Sameer Mahendru and his wife Smt Geetika Mahendru are
                 the major shareholders in M/S Indospirit Distribution Ltd.”
   407.                     Read   plainly,   the   above    paragraph     conveys          in
        unequivocal terms that, at the time of the application dated 09.09.2021,
        the joint venture partners included A-11, A-5 and PW-275. The natural
        and immediate impression created is that these individuals formed part
        of the applicant entity from the very inception of the L-1 application
        process.

   408.                     However, when D-73 (6003), namely the application
        dated 09.09.2021, is examined, a materially different position
        emerges. The applicant had applied as Indospirit Marketing Pvt. Ltd.
        (Joint Venture) with IMPL and IDPL as its constituent partners. The
        names now projected in paragraph 16.20 do not find place as partners
        in that original application. The composition reflected in the charge-


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                             Page no. 203 of 549
        sheet corresponds to a later stage, after reconstitution, and not to the
        application dated 09.09.2021.

   409.                     The distinction is not trivial. The prosecution case
        proceeds on the footing of a pre-planned conspiracy and prior
        crystallisation of roles. By presenting the later composition as if it
        existed at the time of the initial application, the charge-sheet creates
        an impression of continuity and design that is not borne out by the
        document relied upon. The original application does not support the
        inference sought to be drawn.

   410.                     The manner in which paragraph 16.20 is framed, without
        clarifying that the partners mentioned therein were inducted
        subsequently, has the effect of advancing the prosecution theory of
        conspiracy. Had the document D-73 (6003) been read in its proper
        context, the foundation for suggesting that A-11, A-5 and PW-275
        were embedded in the applicant entity at the inception would not stand.
        The presentation in the charge-sheet thus departs from the
        contemporaneous record and tends to mislead by omission of a crucial
        temporal distinction.

                                                              (emphasis supplied)

   411.                     When the chronology is read as a whole, the initial
        application dated 09.09.2021 was in the name of IMPL (JV) with
        IMPL and IDPL as partners. The reconstitution occurred later. Any

        attempt to retrospectively attribute the later partnership structure to the
        original application distorts the sequence of events and artificially
        strengthens the allegation of a pre-existing conspiracy.

   412.                     At that stage, A-5 and A-11 (Butchibabu Gorantala), who
        are projected by the prosecution as proxies of A-17 K. Kavitha, as well
        as PW-275 Prem R. Manduri, who is sought to be linked as a conduit
        of the approver PW-226 Raghav Magunta, were admittedly not part of
        the applicant entity. This assumes significance in view of the
        prosecution’s assertion that an amount of ₹25 crores had already been
        paid as “upfront money” pursuant to the alleged conspiracy. If such
        payment had already been effected and the roles attributed to A-5,
        A-11 and PW-275 had stood crystallised, the absence of these persons
        from the applicant JV at the time of the September 2021 application
        remains unexplained. Even after issuance of the second deficiency
        memo, though the JV was sought to be reconstituted by replacing
        IMPL Pvt. Ltd. with A-5, A-11 and PW-275, the application continued
        to suffer from inherent defects of eligibility.

                                                              (emphasis supplied)

   413.                     The material on record shows that IMPL (JV) failed to
        satisfy the turnover requirement in a manner permissible under the
        Policy, having relied upon impermissible agent-based turnover and
        statutory documents not standing in the name of the L-1 applicant.
        These were not curable procedural deficiencies but went to the root of
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 205 of 549
        qualification, leading to withdrawal of the application dated
        09.09.2021. It was only thereafter that a fresh application was moved
        in the name of M/S Indospirit (JV), with IDL, A-5 and PW-275 as
        partners, wherein the turnover was computed in accordance with the
        Policy, documentary requirements were fulfilled or duly undertaken in
        the applicant’s own name, and the threshold eligibility of ₹150 crores
        was met. The grant of the L-1 licence to M/S Indospirit thus followed
        from objective satisfaction of eligibility conditions, and not from any
        pre-existing assurance or continuity with the earlier IMPL (JV)
        application. Viewed cumulatively, the sequence does not support the
        prosecution theory of a pre-planned conspiracy, advance payment, or
        assured mechanism of recoupment, and correspondingly weakens the
        projection of A-5 and A-11 as conduits acting pursuant to any alleged
        understanding emerging from the purported meeting at ITC,
        Hyderabad.

   414.                     The prosecution has sought to contend that, despite the
        filing of a writ petition by PW-6 Varun Chaudhary before the Hon’ble
        Supreme Court on 05.11.2021 alleging cartelisation, Accused Nos. 1
        and 2 proceeded to grant the L-1 licence to M/S Indospirit on
        05.11.2021 in undue haste and in disregard of pending judicial
        proceedings.

   415.                     The material on record does not support such a
        proposition. PW-5 has stated: “I state that the said petition is regarding

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 206 of 549
        allegations of cartelization amongst Indospirits, Khao Gali, Magunta
        Srinivas Reddy, Balaji Group, etc. The said letter of Varun Chaudhary
        dt. 06.11.2021 regarding filing of the writ petition (Crl.) No.19184 of
        2021 on 05.11.2021 has been forwarded to the lawyers of the
        department on 08.11.2021 as per markings on the said letter by
        Assistant Commissioner (Litigation) Sh. Ajay Kumar Gambhir. He
        also marked the copy of the same to Assistant Commissioner,
        IMFL…”.

   416.                     PW-6 has further produced before the investigating
        agency the original receiving dated 08.11.2021 on his letter dated
        06.11.2021. It thus stands established that although the letter bears the
        date 06.11.2021, it was in fact received in the Department only on
        08.11.2021.

   417.                     At this juncture, it becomes necessary to scrutinise the
        manner in which paragraph 16.25 has been introduced in the charge-
        sheet. The prosecution proceeds on the footing that the petition was
        received in the Excise Department on 05.11.2021, evidently with the
        object of suggesting that, despite awareness of allegations of
        cartelisation and blacklisting, A-1 and A-2 acted thereafter with undue
        haste. The relevant extract reads:

                 “16.25 Investigation revealed that a petition was filed by Shri
                Varun Chaudhary before Hon’ble Supreme Court of India on
                3.11.2021 regarding the same allegations of cartelization and
                blacklisting against M/S Indospirit Group and others. The copy

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 207 of 549
                of the said petition was received in the Excise Department of
                GNCT of Delhi on 5.11.22.”
   418.                     The stress placed upon the date of receipt is clearly
        deliberate. It forms the foundation of the timeline sought to be
        constructed by the prosecution so as to attribute prior knowledge to
        the departmental authorities and to advance the allegation that
        subsequent action was taken in undue haste.

   419.                     However, the record does not support this assertion.
        PW-5, the record keeper and custodian of the inward register, does not
        depose that the complaint was received on 05.11.2021. PW-6, the
        complainant himself, has categorically stated that the complaint was
        got received in the Department on 08.11.2021. The documentary trail
        and the oral evidence thus consistently indicate 08.11.2021 as the date
        of receipt.

   420.                     In this backdrop, the mention of 05.11.2021 in the
        charge-sheet stands at variance with the very material relied upon by
        the prosecution. The advancement of the date has the effect of
        artificially extending the period between receipt of the complaint and
        the impugned action, thereby attempting to lend support to the
        allegation of undue haste. Without such advancement, the foundation
        for that allegation becomes untenable.

   421.                     The investigative process demands fidelity to the record.
        Where the timeline reflected in the charge-sheet departs from the

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 208 of 549
        documentary and oral evidence on record, and that departure
        operates to the prejudice of the accused, the Court cannot overlook the
        inconsistency. The duty of the investigating agency is to present the
        facts as they emerge from the record, not to adapt them to reinforce a
        predetermined narrative.

                                                            (emphasis supplied)

   422.                     The sequence is therefore unambiguous. The alleged
        intimation of filing of the writ petition is dated 06.11.2021; it was
        received on 08.11.2021; and only thereafter was it marked to the
        concerned branch. In the absence of any material showing earlier
        receipt or prior circulation, there is no basis to presume that A-1 and
        A-2 had knowledge of the filing of the petition before 08.11.2021. The
        mere date mentioned on the letter cannot substitute proof of its
        communication or receipt.

   423.                     In this backdrop, the attempt to attribute prior
        knowledge to A-1 and A-2 on the basis of the date of the petition alone,
        while ignoring the proved date of its receipt in the Department, is not
        borne out from the record. The prosecution evidence itself establishes
        the actual timeline. Any suggestion to the contrary amounts to placing
        a version before the Court that is inconsistent with its own
        documentary foundation, which raises serious concern regarding
        fairness in presentation of facts.


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                     Page no. 209 of 549
   424.                     It is equally settled that the filing of a petition does not,
        by itself, operate as a restraint on administrative action. Unless a court
        grants an interim order or stay, statutory authorities are not precluded
        from proceeding in accordance with the governing policy and
        applicable rules. No material has been placed on record to indicate that
        any such interim protection was in force restraining the Department
        from processing or disposing of the application of M/S Indospirit at
        the relevant time.

   425.                     In these circumstances, the continuation of the licensing
        process cannot be characterised as irregular or mala fide. Tested
        against the documentary record, the allegation does not advance
        beyond conjecture.

        Unregistered Joint Venture Agreement (JVA)

   426.                     One of the allegations levelled by the prosecution is that
        M/S Indospirits was granted the L-1 licence without furnishing a
        registered Joint Venture Agreement (JVA). The said allegation, on the
        face of the record, does not withstand scrutiny. PW-17 has
        categorically addressed this issue and has stated “ On being asked
        regarding the non-registered JV agreement and grant of licence to M/S
        Indospirits on the basis of said agreement, I state that it is nowhere
        mentioned in the Policy that JV agreement should be registered,
        hence, in my opinion it was not mandatory...”.


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                             Page no. 210 of 549
   427.                     The aforesaid statement clearly establishes that neither
        the Excise Policy nor the governing licensing framework prescribed
        registration of a Joint Venture Agreement as a mandatory pre-condition
        for consideration or grant of an L-1 licence. Thus, the very foundation
        of the allegation stands negated by the prosecution’s own witness.

   428.                     Even otherwise, there is no statutory mandate requiring
        a Joint Venture Agreement to be compulsorily registered. The
        Registration Act, 1908 exhaustively enumerates the categories of
        documents for which compulsory registration is required, and a Joint
        Venture Agreement does not fall within the ambit of such compulsorily
        registrable instruments. In the absence of any statutory requirement,
        non-registration of a JVA cannot be treated as a legal infirmity.

                                                               (emphasis supplied)

   429.                     A perusal of D-73 (page 5999), containing the checklist
        applicable to applicants seeking an L-1 licence, sets the issue at rest.
        Clause 4 mandates submission of the Memorandum and Articles of
        Association of the company, or the Partnership Deed under the
        Partnership Act, 1932, or the Certificate of Registration in the case of
        a Cooperative Society, or the Partnership Deed under the Limited
        Liability Partnership Act, 2008, or the Joint Venture Agreement
        together with the list of Directors/partners/members of the
        company/firm/society, or Form-32 in the event of change from the
        MOA.
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 211 of 549
   430.                     Significantly, the checklist does not stipulate that the
        Joint Venture Agreement must be a registered instrument. The
        requirement is confined to furnishing the JV Agreement along with
        particulars of the Directors/partners/members, depending upon the
        constitution of the applicant entity. There is no condition that only a
        registered copy would be acceptable.

   431.                     This position finds affirmation in the deposition of
        PW-17, who has stated that the application was scrutinised and
        processed strictly in accordance with the checklist available on the
        portal. When the governing checklist itself does not mandate
        submission of a registered JV Agreement, the argument that non-filing
        of a registered copy constituted any procedural irregularity is without
        basis.

   432.                     In these circumstances, the charge on this count is bereft
        of factual support. The documentary stipulation and the oral statement
        are consistent with each other, and no infirmity is discernible in the
        processing of the application on this aspect.

   433.                     Further, where the parties to the Joint Venture
        themselves do not dispute the execution, validity, or enforceability of
        the agreement, the absence of registration does not render the
        document non-est or defective for the purposes of administrative
        scrutiny. Such a circumstance cannot, by any stretch, constitute a


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 212 of 549
        deficiency warranting rejection of an application for grant of an L-1
        licence.

   434.                     It is also pertinent to note that the L-1 licence granted to
        M/S Indospirits on 05.11.2021 was expressly made subject to
        fulfilment of conditions, which were thereafter finalised on
        08.11.2021. The grant was thus conditional and provisional in nature,
        in conformity with the established licensing procedure.

   435.                     Viewed cumulatively, the allegation premised on the
        absence of a registered Joint Venture Agreement is legally
        unsustainable, contrary to the policy framework, unsupported by
        statutory mandate, and squarely contradicted by the statement of
        PW-17. The prosecution has also failed to point out any mandatory
        statutory document which was required prior to issuance of the L-1
        licence and which was allegedly dispensed with. Once eligibility
        criteria stood satisfied, A-1 had no authority in law to withhold the
        licence dehors the statutory framework.

        Disposal of complaint dated 18.10.2021

   436.                     Though the prosecution has sought to project that it was
        the duty of A-1 and A-2 to deal with the complaint dated 18.10.2021,
        the record itself brings out that the allegation of cross-funding
        pertained to the retail domain, inasmuch as the alleged relationship
        between M/S KGRL and M/S Indospirit was a matter falling within


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                            Page no. 213 of 549
        the retail zone. Such a complaint, therefore, was required to be dealt
        with by the Retail Section, and not confined to the wholesale licensing
        stream. This position stands fortified by the institutional distribution
        of work. The issuance of retail licences (L-7V) was headed by Deputy
        Commissioner Anand Kumar Tewari and Assistant Commissioner
        Pankaj Bhatnagar, whereas wholesale licences (L-1) were processed
        in the section headed by A-1 and A-2. The allocation and distribution
        of work was carried out by Sh. Arva Gopi Krishna (PW-74), the then
        Excise Commissioner. The cartelisation complaint dated 17.10.2021
        was, in fact, marked to both sections, and the process of retail licensing
        was supervised by the TEC.

   437.                     Most decisively, D-186, being the statement under
        Section 164 of Cr.P.C. of Sh. Arva Gopi Krishna (PW-74), records that
        the TEC examined the complaints and “recommended that there is
        no violation of tender conditions, excise policy,” that technical and
        financial bids may be opened, and that upon further examination, the
        department found “no prima facie violation of tender conditions and
        Excise Policy.” PW-74 further records that all documents, including
        EMD details, were forwarded to the Income Tax Department and that
        the department would “wait for the report of the IT.”                    This
        contemporaneous statement squarely contradicts the prosecution’s
        suggestion of suppression or falsity in relation to the cartelisation
        complaint.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 214 of 549
   438.                     The cartelisation complaint dated 18.10.2021 was duly
        examined at the departmental level by the Retail Licence Section,
        which, at the relevant time, was headed by the then Deputy
        Commissioner, Shri Anand Kumar Tewari, and the Assistant
        Commissioner, Shri Pankaj Bhatnagar (PW-270). The complaint was
        processed through the prescribed institutional channel and subjected
        to scrutiny by the concerned branches competent to examine the
        specific allegations raised therein.

   439.                     In the course of such examination, the matter was
        referred to the Accounts Branch for verification of the alleged financial
        irregularities, including the mode and source of deposit of EMD and
        participation fees, which formed the gravamen of the cartelisation
        allegation. The findings of the Accounts Branch were formally
        recorded in the departmental notings, including D-147 (94/N), and
        were taken into consideration while dealing with the complaint.

   440.                     The   relevant   submissions,   as   recorded        in      the
        departmental file and relied upon while disposing of the cartelisation
        complaint, are reproduced below verbatim for ready reference:

                “212…..The Accounts Branch has submitted that the money
                deposited by these firms in respect of E.M.D and participant
                fees by way of demand drafts in favour of the Excise
                Commissioner, treated as financial transactions made by the
                companies. There was no such sub-clause in the clause 6 of the
                tender document to the effect that the demand draft of requisite
                value should only be prepared by the participant

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 215 of 549
                company/entity itself and that too from its own bank account.
                As such, all the demand drafts of requisitioned value whether
                it pertained to EMD or as participation fees, submitted by the
                intending bidders, were accepted by the TEC and were also
                honoured by the bank as and when deposited.
                213 The Accounts branch further submitted that as the source
                of funding (terms and conditions the intending
                bidders/companies managed the funds to deposit E.M.D or
                Participant fees and further, the relation of the alleged company
                with the entity/company from whom the funds were
                managed) may be a matter of economic offence. This fact can
                only be established through intense investigation by the
                specialized investigating agency having expertise in economic
                offences and also having jurisdiction of probe outside Delhi.
                214 It is submitted that based on the documents uploaded by
                the bidder in pre-qualification bid and the clarifications
                received from these bidders later on, the TEC vide its minutes
                dated 04.08.2021 submitted its recommendations to worthy
                Commissioner for approval/consideration and the same had
                been approved and directions were issued to put for draw of
                lots & opening of technical bids and financial bids (P-33/N).
                215 Further, after going through the contents of the reply
                submitted by M/S. Magunta Agro Farms Pvt. Ltd., M/S Raisen
                Marketing Pvt. Ltd. and Khaogali Restaurants Pvt. Ltd. it
                appears that there is no prima facie violations of the relevant
                clauses of Excise policy/Tender document dated 28.06.2021
                and 13/08/2021 by the L-7Z Licensee….”.
   441.                     A conjoint reading of the above notings demonstrates
        that the allegation of cartelisation was not brushed aside mechanically,
        but was examined on objective parameters prescribed under the
        DEP-21/22 and the applicable tender conditions. The Accounts Branch
        categorically recorded that neither Clause 6 of the tender document
        nor any other provision mandated that the EMD or participation fees
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                            Page no. 216 of 549
        must necessarily emanate from the bidder’s own bank account.
        Consequently, the acceptance of demand drafts by the TEC, and their
        subsequent honouring by the bank, was found to be fully compliant
        with the tender framework.

   442.                     Further, the decision-making process was anchored in
        contemporaneous records, including pre-qualification documents,
        bidder clarifications, and the TEC minutes dated 04.08.2021, which
        culminated in approval by the competent authority and issuance of
        directions for draw of lots and opening of technical and financial bids.
        The replies furnished by the concerned licensees were specifically
        examined, leading to a recorded conclusion that no prima facie
        violation of the relevant clauses of the Excise Policy or Tender
        Documents was made out.

   443.                     It is also significant to note that the complaint was
        disposed of only after seeking and examining replies from the entities
        concerned. It is not the case of the prosecution that the TEC or the
        officers heading the Retail Licence Section acted with any mala fide
        intent while dealing with the complaint. On the contrary, the record
        reflects that the Retail Licence Section dealt with the complaint
        diligently and with procedural propriety, confining itself strictly to
        issues falling within its statutory and administrative remit.

   444.                     Once the competent departmental authority, after
        following the prescribed procedure, recorded a finding that no prima
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 217 of 549
        facie violation of the Excise Policy or tender conditions was disclosed,
        the complaint stood concluded at the departmental level. In such
        circumstances, it cannot be contended that Accused Nos. A-1 or A-2
        granted licence to M/S Indospirit by first removing or neutralising the
        allegations contained in the cartelisation complaint. The record,
        instead, demonstrates that the complaint was independently examined,
        answered on merits, and thereby negating any inference of procedural
        impropriety, collusion, or abuse of position.


   445.                     The cumulative effect of this evidence establishes that the
        file moved through a documented and hierarchical decision-making
        process, involving scrutiny at the level of the dealing assistant, Section
        Officer, Assistant Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner. The
        expeditious movement of the file stands explained by the compressed
        timeline necessitated by the implementation of the DEP-21/22, and not
        by any departure from procedure. On the contrary, the record
        demonstrates structured processing, supervisory oversight at every
        stage, and adherence to the established departmental mechanism,
        leaving no room for an inference of procedural irregularity in dealing
        with the complaint dated 18.10.2021.

                                                                 (emphasis supplied)

        Alleged Bribe of ₹30 Lakhs to A-2

   446.                     At the threshold, this Court records that the allegation of
        payment of ₹30 lakhs to A-2 by A-7 for expediting and securing the
        L-1 Licence in favour of M/S Indospirits, is founded solely upon the
        statement of the approver, PW-20, who is projected by the prosecution
        as its principal witness. It is well-settled that the statement of an
        approver, by its very nature, does not attain probative assurance unless
        it is independently corroborated on material particulars. The real
        inquiry, therefore, is not confined only to whether PW-20 has levelled
        such an allegation, but whether the record discloses any legally
        sustainable independent corroboration lending assurance to his
        version.

   447.                     A careful examination of the sequence of statements of
        approver PW-20 places the Court on guard. In his first statement
        recorded under Section 161 of Cr.P.C. dated 21.09.2022, running into
        12 pages and purporting to cover the prosecution narrative in detail,
        PW-20 makes no reference whatsoever to any payment of ₹30 lakhs
        or to any demand allegedly made by A-2. The said silence persists in
        the subsequent confessional statement recorded before the Ld. Judicial
        Magistrate on 30.09.2022, consisting of 17 pages, wherein again no
        such allegation finds place. Even thereafter, when supplementary
        statement under Section 161 of Cr.P.C. was recorded on 05.10.2022,
        the record remains bereft of any such assertion.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 219 of 549
                                                                (emphasis supplied)

   448.                     It is only in the subsequent supplementary statement
        dated 27.10.2022 recorded under Section 161 of Cr.P.C. that, for the
        first time, PW-20 introduces a version suggesting such payment, and
        that too in the nature of hearsay, by stating: “...Sameer Mahendru
        met me sometime in the end of October 2021 near Khan Market in
        Delhi and told me that his L-1 licence of Indospirits is not being issued
        by the Excise Department and he has met with Sh. Narender Singh,
        Assistant Commissioner, and paid him ₹30 lakhs…”.

   449.                     The belated surfacing of so serious an allegation, absent
        from earlier statements, especially from the confessional statement
        under Section 164 of Cr.P.C., yet introduced through a statement under
        Section 161 of Cr.P.C., calls for heightened judicial caution. At this
        stage, the Court is faced with the legal issue whether the introduction
        of a new allegation under Section 161 of Cr.P.C., which did not find
        mention in the statement recorded under Section 164 of Cr.P.C., can
        by itself carry sufficient weight at the stage of charge, and what would
        be the evidentiary worth of such an improved version. The answer to
        this question, as noted by the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi in case
        titled as Asit Mukherjee vs. State, 2024 SCC OnLine Del 1876,
        wherein it is stated that the introduction of a new allegation which does
        not find mention in the statement recorded under Section 164 of
        Cr.P.C., and is thereafter sought to be introduced through a statement

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 220 of 549
        under Section 161 of Cr.P.C., would not be sufficient to charge the
        accused. The relevant extract is reproduced below for ready
        reference:

                “10….The statement of the victim/complainant u/s 164 Cr.P.C.
                was recorded on 19.02.2018 but for the reasons best known to
                her she has not levelled any allegations against the petitioner in
                her said statement. When in her first complaint dated
                17.02.2018 she made allegations against the petitioner then
                what transpired between the two days i.e. between 17.02.2018
                and 19.02.2018 that she has not made any allegations against
                the petitioner in her statement recorded u/s 164 Cr.P.C. which
                clearly shows her malafides against the petitioner. She has even
                failed to inform her husband regarding the conduct of the
                petitioner and despite that she kept on visiting the office of
                the petitioner without making any complaint in regard to his
                conduct.
                11. The supplementary statement of the victim was recorded on
                27.02.2018 but what prompted the IO to record the
                supplementary statement of the victim when her statement u/s
                164 Cr.P.C. was already recorded on 19.02.2018. Now in the
                supplementary statement the victim has stated that the
                petitioner used to talk loosely with her but she does not
                remember the context of the talks. Here again the victim fails
                to mention as to what words were used by the petitioner against
                her which were offensive and amounted to outrage her
                modesty. During the course of the arguments, it was also
                pointed out by the Ld. counsel for the petitioner that as per
                the CDR analysis no calls were found to be made by the
                petitioner to the victim….”.
   450.                     A similar concern was expressed by the Hon’ble High
        Court of Allahabad in case titled as Dharmendra and Ors. vs. State of
        U.P. (Criminal Misc. Bail Application Nos. 31695, 20006 and 30288

        of 2021, decided on 01.10.2021, where the High Court took note of an
        emerging practice concerning recording of supplementary statements
        under Section 161 of Cr.P.C. after recording of statement under section
        164 of Cr.P.C and issued directions to the DGP of the State to take
        appropriate steps for discontinuing such a practice. The relevant
        extract is reproduced below for ready reference:

                “9…In the matters in hand the prosecutrix/victim after giving
                her statement under Section 161 of the Code levelling
                allegations of rape against the accused, has given up the same
                in her statement recorded under Section 164 of the Code. The
                Investigating Officer then records the statement of the
                prosecutrix/victim again under Section 161 of the Codce and
                puts specific questions to her with regards to the said variations
                in her statements and records her answers to the said
                questions.
                10. The said action of the Investigating Officer is not
                appreciable. Putting questions to the prosecutrix/victim with
                regards to the change in version by her in the statements
                under Section 161 of the Code and in the statement under
                Section 164 of the code, clearly shows disrespect to the courts
                who have recorded the statements under Section 164 of the
                Code. The said statements under Section 164 of the code
                recorded by Judicial Magistrates is in discharge of their judicial
                functions and the act of recording of the said statements was a
                judicial act which performed by a public servant while
                discharging his judicial functions. The said document is
                relevant under Section 35 of Indian Evidence Act and also
                under Section 72 of Indian Evidence Act and, as such, assumes
                the character of being a public document.
                11. The statement made by the prosecutrix/victim under section
                164 of the Code before the Magistrate stands on a high pedestal
                and sanctity during the course of investigation than that of her

                statement recorded under section 161 of the Code by the
                Investigating Officer.
                12. Though the Investigating Agency has unfettered powers to
                investigate a matter, but they cannot on their whims and fancy
                adopt a procedure which would clearly be challenging the
                sanctity of an act done by a court of law while discharge of a
                judicial function. By putting questions to the
                prosecutrix/victim in her second statement under Section 161
                of the Code after recording of the statement under Section
                164 of the Code relating to different versions in the said two
                statements, the Investigating Officer cannot frustrate the same
                and also make an attempt to make the purpose of the said
                exercise look a farce.
                13. The act of putting specific questions pertaining to the
                variations in the said two statements by the Investigating
                Officer is viewed with an impression of clearly challenging the
                authority of a judicial act. The Investigating Officers have
                clearly exceeded their jurisdiction by proceedings to
                investigate in such a manner. The same appears to be with a
                sole purpose to frustrate the statements recorded by a
                Magistrate.
                14. Even the Uttar Pradesh Police Regulations while dealing
                with the particular duties of Police Officers for
                “Investigations” in its Chapter XI do not in any manner
                authorize the Investigating Officers to act as such. Although
                Paragraph-107 of the same states that the Investigating
                Officer would not act as a mere clerk while recordings of
                statements but has to observe and infer. Paragraph-109
                empowers for recording of supplementary statements. But the
                manner in which supplementary statements in the present
                matters have been recorded clearly show that they are for the
                sole purpose to put the variations to the witnesses and record
                the same.
                15. This court thus finds that the manner in which the
                supplementary statements are recorded and the purpose for
                recording of the same is only and solely for frustrating the

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 223 of 549
                purpose of statements recorded under Section 164 of the Code
                and to negate and defeat the earlier statement of the
                prosecutrix/victim given under section 164 of the Code
                whether it is in favour or against the accused otherwise the
                sanctity of the statement under section 164 of the Code will
                loose its value. The same is neither the intent of Investigation
                nor is the purpose of it.
                                                             (emphasis supplied)

                16. The Director General of Police, Uttar Pradesh Lucknow is
                directed to look into the said new trend of Investigation as
                adopted and issue suitable guidelines for such matter so that the
                sanctity and authority of judicial proceedings are maintained
                and they should not be frustrated by any act done during
                Investigation….”.
                                                                 (emphasis supplied)

   451.                     These observations underscore that even if such a course
        may not, in a given case, be held to be per se illegal, it is a practice
        which cannot be encouraged, as it trenches upon the fundamental
        requirement of a fair investigation. The present case, prima facie,
        stands on an even more disquieting footing. Here, a confessional
        statement under Section 164 of Cr.P.C. of a person who was himself a
        participant to the crime had already been recorded. In such a situation,
        the investigative agency occupies a position of dominance,
        particularly when the maker of the statement thereafter seeks pardon
        from the Court. The adoption of a subsequent course of recording
        supplementary statements under Section 161 of Cr.P.C., in the above
        backdrop, has the effect of diluting the sanctity and purpose of the


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                            Page no. 224 of 549
        safeguards embedded in Section 164 of Cr.P.C. The statutory
        framework incorporates stringent safeguards in relation to the
        recording of confessional statements. It unequivocally assures the
        accused that, should he choose not to make a confession, he shall not
        be remanded to police custody. It further prohibits the recording of any
        confession by a police officer, even if such officer has been vested
        with any of the powers of a Magistrate under any law for the time
        being in force. Where a confession is recorded, the Judicial Magistrate
        is obliged to record a memorandum certifying that the accused was
        duly cautioned that he was not bound to make the statement and that,
        if made, it could be used as evidence against him, and further
        certifying that the confession was made voluntarily and constitutes a
        full and true account of the statement. The relevant portion of the
        Section 164 of Cr.P.C. is reproduced below for ready reference:

        “Provided further that no confession shall be recorded by a police
        officer on whom any power of a Magistrate has been conferred under
        any law for the time being in force….(4) Any such confession shall be
        recorded in the manner provided in section 281 for recording the
        examination of an accused person and shall be signed by the person
        making the confession; and the Magistrate shall make a memorandum
        at the foot of such record to the following effect:

                “….I have explained to (name) that he is not bound to make a
                confession and that, if he does so, any confession
                he may make may be used as evidence against him and I

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 225 of 549
                believe that this confession was voluntarily made. It
                was taken in my presence and hearing, and was read over to the
                person making it and admitted by him to be correct, and it
                contains a full and true account of the statement made by him.
                                                 (Signed) A. B. Magistrate…”.
   452.                     The legislature has thus incorporated detailed safeguards
        for recording the confessional statement of an accused, as compared
        to the statement of a witness, to ensure voluntariness before recording
        such confession. These safeguards operate in consonance with
        Sections 25 to 30 of the Indian Evidence Act, which embody the
        general principle that a confession to the police or while in police
        custody is inadmissible. In this factual backdrop, the resort to
        recording supplementary statements under Section 161 of Cr.P.C. for
        the purpose of introducing new incriminating assertions appears, at the
        very least, impermissible in principle. In any event, the Court would
        be obliged to examine such allegations with circumspection and to
        apply the settled test applicable to approver evidence, namely, that it
        must be independently corroborated on material particulars.

                                                                (emphasis supplied)

   453.                     The concern deepens when one notes that PW-20 was
        thereafter granted pardon on 16.11.2022, and his confessional
        statement under Section 306(4) of CrPC was recorded on 24.11.2022.
        In this post-pardon statement, he states that “on 28/29 October 2021
        Samir gave ₹30 lakhs to Narender Singh”, and he not only reiterates

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 226 of 549
        the allegation of ₹30 lakhs, but further introduces a new narrative and
        new accused, implicating the then Excise Commissioner, and referring
        to certain inspectors, thereby suggesting that another payment to the
        Assistant Commissioner (A-2) was made on his behalf. The approver
        states: “shops were to be opened on 17 November 2021. Abhishek was
        facing difficulty in starting the shops. The government servants, in
        particular the Excise Commissioner and inspectors, were asking for
        money. To address the situation, Abhishek told me to meet the
        Commissioner of Excise. Vijay Nair told me to meet the Assistant
        Commissioner Sh. Narender Singh. He (Narender) agreed to take ₹3
        lakh per shop and assured that the work will be done. I gave him ₹30
        lakhs in cash at Khan Market. I made Narender and Abhishek
        coordinate through me. Total ₹2.10 crores were given to Narender
        through me …”.

   454.                     Significantly, after the recording of the statement under
        Section 306(4) of CrPC, the investigating agency again examined
        PW-20 on three occasions, 05.04.2023, 23.04.2023, and 17.10.2023,
        by recording supplementary statements under Section 161 of Cr.P.C..
        In none of these statements does PW-20 reiterate or elaborate upon the
        alleged payment of ₹30 lakhs or the payment of Rs. 2.10 crore. The
        Court finds it difficult to reconcile how an allegation of such gravity,
        if rooted in direct personal knowledge, repeatedly disappears from the
        witness’s narrative only to resurface selectively at a particular

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 227 of 549
        juncture. The Court is, therefore, again confronted with the question
        as to whether the repeated recording of statements under Section 161
        of Cr.P.C. by the CBI, in the manner reflected on record, is permissible
        after the recording of his statement under Section 306(4) of Cr.P.C,
        and what would be the evidentiary value thereof for the purpose of
        charge. The question appears to arise in the same context as earlier;
        however, it assumes a distinct dimension when examined in light of
        the condition of full and true disclosure.

   455.                     The statutory scheme under Sections 306 and 308 of
        Cr.P.C. casts a clear obligation on the prosecution to ensure that an
        accused who has been tendered pardon fulfils the condition of
        “making a full and true disclosure of the whole of the circumstances
        within his knowledge relative to the offence and to every other person
        concerned, whether as principal or abettor, in the commission
        thereof.” This condition cannot be treated as a mere formality, as it is
        intended to ensure that the approver is mandatorily required: (i) to
        make a full and true disclosure; (ii) of the whole of the circumstances
        within his knowledge; (iii) relative to the offence; and (iv) concerning
        every other person involved, whether as principal or abettor. The
        subsequent supplementary statements recorded under Section 161 of
        Cr.P.C. after the statement recorded under Section 306(4) of Cr.P.C.,
        which itself was recorded on the above condition, prima facie raise a
        serious issue as to compliance with the condition on which pardon was

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                    Page no. 228 of 549
        tendered. If the material on record suggested that the disclosure was
        not full and true, the investigating agency was expected to consider
        recourse to Section 308 of Cr.P.C. for seeking withdrawl of pardon and
        trying the approver as an accused. Instead, the investigating agency
        proceeded to record three further supplementary statements under
        Section 161 of Cr.P.C., a course which, on the face of it, warrants
        scrutiny.

                                                           (emphasis supplied)

   456.                     Where an approver’s statement contains serious
        allegations against public servants, the investigating agency is
        expected to test such disclosure for completeness and veracity and, if
        found wanting, to consider the consequences contemplated under
        Section 308 of Cr.P.C for seeking withdrawl of pardon. Any
        indifference to this statutory responsibility, whether by failure to
        examine the disclosure or by selectively overlooking inconvenient
        portions, cannot be lightly disregarded. Despite the presence therein
        of a specific allegation touching upon demand of bribe against the then
        Excise Commissioner, the prosecution has chosen to cite him as a
        witness, stating that no incriminating material was found against him.

   457.                     This Court is constrained to record, in clear and
        unmistakable terms, its serious displeasure at the manner in which the
        confessional statement under Section 306 (4) of Cr.P.C. was dealt with
        by the investigating agency.

       Conduct of the Investigating Officer and impact on fair trial

   458.                     What is even more disquieting is that the investigating
        agency initially represented to this Court that a copy of the said
        statement had not been supplied to it. However, upon the opening of
        the sealed cover and careful perusal of the record contained therein,
        it is found that the learned ACMM had categorically directed, “The
        copy of statement be given to the IO, if application is moved to said
        effect and statement alongwith application and proceedings be sent
        to concerned court in sealed envelope through proper channel.” It
        subsequently emerged that the Investigating Agency had, in fact,
        received a copy of the statement upon submission of his own
        application of the same date, wherein at the bottom of the handwritten
        application the words “submitted please” appear, coupled with the
        endorsement “Received a copy” on the first page of the proceedings
        which took place for recording of the confessional statement under
        Section 306(4) of Cr.P.C., and the original application was found
        inside the sealed envelope.

   459.                          A representation so made, which stands squarely
        contradicted by the record itself, cannot be countenanced. The conduct
        reflected from the record is wholly unsatisfactory and inconsistent
        with the duty of fairness, candour and transparency expected of an
        investigating agency. Further, the said statement was not supplied to
        the accused persons, a lapse that directly impinges upon the fairness

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 230 of 549
        of the investigation and strikes at the very root of procedural
        propriety.

   460.                     The prosecution’s own stand further weakens the
        approver’s version. When the then Excise Commissioner has been
        examined as a prosecution witness on the premise that no material
        was found against him, the allegation that any bribe was demanded or
        collected on his behalf stands considerably diluted and, in the absence
        of corroboration on material particulars, cannot be sustained. Once this
        link is broken, the allegation against A-2 remains unsupported by any
        independent or objective material.

   461.                     The record reveals a circumstance of considerable legal
        significance. The Investigating Officer has, in clear and categorical
        terms, recorded a finding that no incriminating material was found
        against the then Excise Commissioner, who has consequently been
        impleaded as a prosecution witness (PW-74). This admission by the
        investigating agency is not a matter of inference but flows directly
        from its own assessment, and unequivocally reflects that the
        allegations, at least to that extent, were found to be unsubstantiated
        and devoid of factual foundation.

   462.                     Viewed in this backdrop, the subsequent conduct of the
        Investigating Agency in repeatedly recording supplementary
        statements of the approver under Section 161 of Cr.P.C., even after the
        grant of pardon, assumes critical importance. The very necessity of
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 231 of 549
        recording multiple post-pardon statements is indicative of the fact that
        the disclosure made by the approver at the relevant stages was neither
        complete nor exhaustive. A pardon under the Cr.P.C. is not an
        unqualified or unconditional indulgence; it is tendered subject to strict
        and well-defined conditions. Even at the cost of repetition, these
        conditions oblige the approver: (i) to make a full and true disclosure;
        (ii) of the whole of the circumstances within his knowledge; (iii)
        relating to the offence; and (iv) concerning every other person
        involved therein, whether as a principal or as an abettor.

   463.                     The record, on its face, discloses a breach of these
        foundational conditions. The emergence of new facts, fresh
        explanations, and even additional accused persons, solely on the basis
        of supplementary statements recorded under Section 161 of Cr.P.C.
        after the grant of pardon, demonstrates that the approver did not
        comply with the essential requirement of making a full and true
        disclosure at the time when such disclosure was statutorily mandated.
        This is not a mere procedural lapse but goes to the root of the legality
        and sustainability of the pardon itself.

                                                              (emphasis supplied)

   464.                     What further compounds the matter is that, despite such
        apparent non-compliance, the prosecution has not deemed it necessary
        to seek withdrawal or forfeiture of the tender of pardon, as
        contemplated under the statutory scheme. The Court finds it difficult
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 232 of 549
        to comprehend the rationale behind this omission. Instead of invoking
        the legal consequence of breach of pardon conditions, the investigating
        agency has chosen to rely upon successive Section 161 supplementary
        statements to progressively build, supplement, and reshape the
        prosecution narrative. Such an approach effectively permits the
        approver to enjoy the benefit of immunity, while simultaneously
        allowing the prosecution to fill gaps, introduce new versions, and
        widen the net of accused persons on the strength of statements which,
        in law, are of a limited and suspect evidentiary worth.
                                                             (emphasis supplied)

   465.                     The evidentiary value and legal admissibility of such
        post-pardon supplementary statements recorded under Section 161 of
        Cr.P.C., particularly in the context of an approver who has failed to
        adhere to the conditions of pardon, have been examined and dealt with
        in detail. For the present, it suffices to note that this course of action
        not only undermines the statutory discipline governing approver
        evidence, but also raises serious concerns regarding fairness,
        reliability, and the integrity of the investigative process itself.

                                                              (emphasis supplied)

   466.                     The Court also notes that the allegation regarding
        payment of ₹30 lakhs purportedly by A-2 is plainly hearsay. Such an
        assertion, in the absence of contemporaneous documentary support,
        recovery, or statement from any witness speaking from direct
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 233 of 549
        knowledge, cannot be accorded evidentiary value even at the stage of
        charge. Further, the circumstance that A-1 was arrayed as an accused
        and chargesheeted at the forefront, despite the absence of any direct or
        indirect allegation against him in this narrative, accentuates the
        fragility of the prosecution’s approach. There is not even a single
        allegation in the statements of approver PW-20 naming A-1 as the
        recipient or stating that A-2 acted on his behalf. This Court notes that
        it is for the first time that it has come across a charge-sheet in which
        as many as seven statements of an approver have been recorded. No
        decision of any higher court has been placed before this Court to show
        that such a course has been adopted or approved in any other case.

                                                              (emphasis supplied)

   467.                     Viewed cumulatively, the allegation of payment of ₹30
        lakhs is founded on a solitary, shifting, and hearsay version of an
        approver, marked by late introduction, subsequent embellishment, and
        selective silence. The manner in which the investigating agency has
        dealt with the approver’s statements, coupled with the absence of
        independent corroboration on material particulars, renders the
        allegation legally infirm. Even at the stage of consideration of charge,
        such a solitary approver statement, unsupported by credible
        corroborative material, cannot, by itself, furnish a sound basis for
        drawing grave suspicion against the accused.

   468.                     The prosecution witnesses discloses no demand, no
        acceptance, no abuse of official position, and no meeting of minds so
        as to attract offences under PC Act, 1988. The administrative acts
        attributed to A-1 and A-2 are documented, supervised, policy-aligned
        and institutionally vetted. The allegations founded on PW-20’s
        statement stand neutralised by his own omissions in the statement
        recorded under Section 164 of Cr.P.C. Continuation of proceedings on
        such material would amount to subjecting the accused to trial on
        conjecture rather than legally admissible evidence.

   469.                     Upon a careful, close and dispassionate scrutiny of the
        material placed on record, it becomes evident that the allegations
        levelled by the CBI against A-1 and A-2 are not the product of an
        objective or impartial investigation. The record, on the contrary,
        reveals a pre-meditated and choreographed exercise, wherein roles
        appear to have been retrospectively assigned to suit a preconceived
        narrative. What is particularly disturbing is the complete disregard
        shown by the investigating officer to the fact that public servants, who
        were discharging their official duties on a day-to-day basis for the
        effective implementation of a governmental policy, have been
        subjected to criminal prosecution solely on the basis of inadmissible
        hearsay attributed to an approver, despite the investigation yielding no
        material against them.

                                                               (emphasis supplied)

   470.                     The Court cannot lose sight of the fact that the period
        during which their conduct is sought to be questioned coincided with
        an unprecedented national crisis, when the entire country was
        grappling with the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
        During this phase, the officials concerned were performing their duties
        under extraordinary pressure, often at personal risk, to ensure timely
        implementation of policy measures so that essential governance
        functions continued and the State did not suffer avoidable loss of
        revenue.

   471.                     A government servant occupies an inherently vulnerable
        position, being duty-bound to take decisions and exercise discretion in
        the course of official functions. Viewed in this backdrop, the Court
        finds it difficult to comprehend how, in the admitted absence of
        incriminating material, these public servants were arrayed as accused,
        and how sanction for their prosecution came to be accorded despite
        the lack of any admissible material against A-1 and A-2. Such a
        prosecutorial construct is intrinsically fragile and cannot withstand
        judicial scrutiny when tested on the anvil of settled principles
        governing appreciation of evidence. The manner in which the
        investigation has been conducted, far from conforming to the
        discipline of a fair and lawful investigation, discloses a calculated and
        sustained assault on the foundational tenets of the rule of law.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 236 of 549
   472.                     Equally troubling is the conduct of retaining an
        individual in the column of “suspect” while simultaneously presenting
        the very same person as a prosecution witness at the stage of filing of
        the charge-sheet. In the case at hand, Arva Gopi Krishna, the then
        Excise Commissioner, and Anand Kumar Tewari, the then Deputy
        Commissioner, have been placed in Column No. 12 and Arva Gopi
        Krishna has been cited as prosecution witness, namely PW-74. This
        self-contradictory stance cannot be brushed aside as a mere procedural
        irregularity. It betrays a conscious and calculated stratagem by which
        the investigating officer has sought to keep the narrative deliberately
        fluid, relying upon the individual’s statement to prop up the
        prosecution case, while at the same time preserving the option of
        implicating that very person should the case, as projected, fail to
        withstand judicial scrutiny. Such dual positioning unmistakably
        reveals that the investigating officer was, from the outset, conscious of
        the inherent fragility of the allegations being advanced and
        apprehensive that the version placed before the Court might not
        survive close judicial examination.

                                                            (emphasis supplied)

   473.                     This approach does not reflect prudence; it reveals
        anticipatory manipulation, designed to protect the investigator rather
        than to assist the Court in its pursuit of truth. It stands in stark
        opposition to the very concept of a fair investigation, which is an

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                     Page no. 237 of 549
        integral facet of due process. An investigating officer is not expected
        to act with tactical cleverness or strategic flexibility; he is required to
        proceed with candour, neutrality and unwavering fidelity to the factual
        record. An investigation must rest on a clear, consistent and principled
        assessment of the material collected, and not on calculated ambiguity
        intended to preserve future prosecutorial options.

   474.                     The Court is therefore constrained to observe that such a
        course of action reduces the investigative process to a self-serving
        exercise, where legal technicalities are invoked not to uncover the
        truth, but to shield investigative lapses and to construct a post-facto
        defence in the event that suppression or distortion of material facts is
        exposed during judicial scrutiny. Such conduct amounts to a conscious
        abuse of official position and strikes at the very core of the criminal
        justice system.

   475.                     In these circumstances, the course consistent with the
        duty of the Court is not merely to discount the tainted investigative
        material, but also to recommend initiation of appropriate departmental
        proceedings against the erring investigating officer for framing A-1 as
        an accused in the absence of any material against him, so that
        accountability is fixed and the institutional credibility of the
        investigative machinery is preserved. Reliance is placed upon the
        judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Gajoo vs. State of
        Uttarakhand (2012) 9 SCC 532. To permit such conduct to pass

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 238 of 549
        without consequence would erode public confidence in the
        administration of criminal justice and would amount to tacit judicial
        approval of investigative impropriety, an outcome which the rule of
        law does not permit.

        Allegation against A-18

   476.                     The prosecution alleges that A-18, Arvind Kejriwal, in
        his capacity as the Chief Minister of Delhi, occupied the apex position
        in, and exercised overarching control over, the criminal conspiracy
        relating to the formulation and implementation of the DEP-21/22. It is
        alleged that the policy was approved and implemented with his
        conscious knowledge that it conferred undue pecuniary advantage
        upon select private liquor interests associated with the so-called
        “South Group”, and that Cabinet approvals, including Cabinet
        Decisions, were accorded with such awareness. The prosecution
        further alleges that A-18 was cognisant of the generation of illegal
        gratification arising from the policy framework and of its intended
        political utilisation, including for election-related purposes, and that
        he permitted the continuation of the policy and the alleged illicit
        arrangements despite knowledge of these aspects. According to the
        prosecution, his role was not limited to formal approval but extended
        to providing political sanction, protection and continuity to the acts of
        co-conspirators, thereby placing him at the apex of the alleged
        conspiracy and rendering him liable for the acts committed in

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 239 of 549
        furtherance thereof by public servants, intermediaries and private
        persons involved in the excise policy matter.

        Analysis

   477.                     The prosecution seeks to connect A-18 mainly on the
        basis of one sentence in the statement of the witness, namely PW-225
        Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy: “Thereafter, he told me that Ms. K.
        Kavitha, daughter of Shri K. Chandershekhar Rao, the then CM of
        Telangana would be contacting me in this regard.”

   478.                 At the outset, it is to be noted that the name of A-18 appears
        for the first time in the statement of PW-225 Magunta Sreenivasulu
        Reddy dated 03.01.2024. This statement was recorded in response to
        a specific query by the Investigating Officer as to whether he had met
        A-18 and whether anyone else was present at that time. The
        prosecution seeks to base the allegation against A-18 primarily on
        what is stated in that statement. The relevant extract relied upon by the
        prosecution reads as under:

                “…On 16.03.2021, I went to the Delhi Secretariat and met Shri
                Arvind Kejriwal in his chamber at around 04:30 PM. When I
                reached there, around 10–12 persons were standing to meet
                Shri Arvind Kejriwal… Shri Arvind Kejriwal offered me a
                chair and told me that we could very well do the liquor business
                in Delhi and he would be supporting us in that. Thereafter, he
                told me that Ms. K Kavitha, daughter of Shri K
                Chandershekhar Rao, the then CM of Telangana would be
                contacting me in this regard. Shri Arvind Kejriwal further told


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 240 of 549
                me to provide some monetary funding to his Aam Aadmi Party.
                It was a brief meeting, which lasted around 6–7 minutes…”.
   479.                     It is this extract, and particularly the line referring to Ms.
        K. Kavitha contacting the witness, on which the prosecution rests its
        case to connect A-18 with the alleged conspiracy. The question which
        arises is whether this statement, by itself, is sufficient to prima facie
        link A-18 with the alleged conspiracy. It cannot be disputed that, in a
        given case, even a single circumstance may assume significance if it
        forms part of a larger chain pointing towards a prior meeting of minds
        and acts done in furtherance of a common object. If the prosecution is
        able to demonstrate that such a circumstance is self-sufficient and
        intrinsically incriminating, it may legitimately contribute to raising
        grave suspicion.

   480.                     However, the statement relied upon, when read in
        isolation, does not, on its plain terms, attribute any overtly illegal act.
        It does not, by itself, disclose the commission of an offence or an
        agreement to commit one. Its evidentiary value therefore depends
        entirely on whether it can be placed within a complete and coherent
        chain of circumstances. It is settled that in cases based on
        circumstantial evidence, the prosecution is not required, at the stage of
        charge, to establish the entire chain with the same degree of certainty
        as at the stage of conviction. Conspiracy is rarely proved by direct
        evidence and may be inferred from surrounding circumstances. At the
        same time, even at the prima facie stage, the circumstances relied upon
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                              Page no. 241 of 549
        must show reasonable continuity and proximity. Where there is a clear
        disconnection, or where the circumstances do not naturally align, the
        inference of conspiracy cannot rest on assumption.

   481.                     The investigating agency may be granted some latitude
        in proving the manner in which a conspiracy was executed. But such
        latitude does not extend to foundational facts. The basic links which
        anchor the alleged conspiracy must be clearly borne out from the
        material collected. If the prosecution seeks the benefit of inference, the
        initial facts from which such inference is to be drawn must themselves
        be firmly placed on record. A conspiracy cannot remain unanchored;
        it must rest on identifiable material.

   482.                     In the present context, the case against A-18 is projected
        as resting on circumstantial evidence and on the roles attributed to
        certain other accused said to be directly associated with him. If the
        material against such persons does not, by itself, survive to raise grave
        suspicion, then the case against A-18, whose role is stated to be
        supervisory or overarching, would necessarily stand on a weakened
        footing. Liability for conspiracy cannot be inferred in isolation. It must
        arise from circumstances which are proximate, consistent and
        mutually reinforcing. In the absence of such connecting material, a
        solitary statement of the nature relied upon cannot, by itself, meet the
        legal threshold required to proceed further.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 242 of 549
   483.                     The role attributed to A-18 calls for careful and
        structured examination. It cannot be viewed in isolation, nor can it be
        assessed merely on the strength of broad allegations. The analysis has
        to proceed on two distinct but interrelated planes. First, it must be
        examined in the backdrop of the roles attributed to the other accused
        persons. Secondly, it must be examined in the context of the
        formulation and approval of the Excise Policy itself, bearing in mind
        the constitutional position occupied by A-18 as the Chief Minister at
        the relevant time.

   484.                     In this regard, the role of A-8 assumes particular
        relevance. A-8 was heading the Excise Department as the Deputy
        Chief Minister and was directly associated with the policy domain in
        question. A-18, on the other hand, was the Chief Minister. The
        prosecution seeks to project A-18 as the central figure who allegedly
        manipulated the policy for the benefit of the so-called “South Group”
        and for the purpose of recouping alleged upfront money. This
        allegation is of a serious nature and forms the foundation upon which
        the subsequent allegations are constructed.

   485.                     The prosecution further attempts to connect A-18 with
        the alleged utilisation of funds in the Goa election. However, this
        allegation is consequential and derivative. If the foundational
        allegation, namely, manipulation of policy in furtherance of a criminal
        design, does not prima facie withstand scrutiny, then the subsequent

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 243 of 549
        allegation regarding utilisation of funds would automatically lose its
        footing. The latter cannot survive independently if the former fails to
        disclose the necessary ingredients of conspiracy or criminal
        misconduct.

   486.                     It is also significant that the inception of the alleged role
        of A-18 emerges for the first time in the Fourth Supplementary
        Charge-sheet. Until that stage, his name did not figure in the
        prosecution narrative in the manner now sought to be projected. The
        principal material relied upon to implicate him is the statement of
        PW-225, read in alignment with the statement of PW-226 (Raghav
        Magunta Reddy), who has been examined as an approver. It is through
        this material that the prosecution seeks to bring A-18 within the fold
        of the larger alleged conspiracy.

   487.                     In these circumstances, it would be appropriate to
        commence the analysis from the allegations contained in the Fourth
        Supplementary Charge-sheet, being the chargesheet under which A-18
        was arrayed as an accused. The Court shall therefore examine, in the
        first instance, the statement of PW-225, its contents, its legal character,
        and its capacity, if any, to connect A-18 with the alleged conspiracy.
        Only thereafter can the broader allegation of overarching control or
        political sanction be meaningfully assessed on the touchstone of the
        material placed on record.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                             Page no. 244 of 549
   488.                     Even if the narration of PW-225’s in his own statement
        accepted arguendo at face value, unmistakably discloses his conscious
        and active participation in the very arrangement which the prosecution
        seeks to characterise as a criminal conspiracy. His statement does not
        place him in the position of a neutral, chance or peripheral witness. On
        the contrary, he candidly acknowledges that he decided to enter the
        Delhi liquor business, sought an appointment with the Chief Minister
        for “support and guidance”, thereafter met A-17 (Ms. K. Kavitha),
        discussed entry into the Delhi liquor business, entertained and
        negotiated a demand of ₹100 crores as “upfront money”, and then
        entrusted the actual handling of finances and logistics to his son who
        is approver Pw -226 . His own admissions, inter alia, include:

                “…I came to know that a DEP-21/22 for the year 2021-22 was
                coming in Delhi. In order to expand the business, I decided to
                enter in the liquor business at Delhi.”
                “I wanted to meet Shri Arvind Kejriwal, CM, Delhi for
                having some support and guidance for entering into the liquor
                business at Delhi…”
                “In the said meeting with Ms. K Kavitha, she told me that total
                amount of Rs. 100 Crores has to be arranged… She
                demanded Rs. 50 Crores from me…”
                “I told her that I would be discussing this matter with my son
                Raghav and get back in few days.”
                “the matter regarding the payment of upfront money was
                totally handled by my son Shri Raghav… total payment of
                Rs. 25 Crores as upfront money was made by him…”.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 245 of 549
   489.                     Read cumulatively, these admissions leave no manner of
        doubt that PW-225 is not narrating events as an external observer. His
        statement is self-incriminating in nature and discloses that both he and
        his son (PW-226) were active participants in the alleged transaction
        chain which the prosecution labels as conspiratorial. Though he has
        not been formally tendered pardon or examined as an approver, the
        intrinsic character of his statement places him squarely within the zone
        of a participant admitting engagement with the alleged scheme.

   490.                     A serious infirmity that surfaces in the present matter is
        the apparent misconception of the legal position by the investigating
        and prosecuting agencies with regard to the evidentiary value of
        certain witnesses. The record indicates that individuals who have, in
        their own statements, admitted participation in the alleged transaction
        have been examined merely as prosecution witnesses, without being
        arraigned as accused and without being tendered pardon as approvers.
        Yet, their statement appears to have been treated on par with that of
        wholly independent witnesses. It is equally possible that the agencies
        were conscious of the settled position in law, but nevertheless sought
        to project such witnesses as independent in order to lend greater
        weight to their case.

   491.                     This approach overlooks the settled distinction in
        criminal jurisprudence between an independent witness and one who
        is a participant in the alleged offence. It is undoubtedly within the

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 246 of 549
        discretion of the investigating agency to examine a co-participant as a
        witness, even without formally making him an accused or an approver.
        Such latitude exists to ensure that the truth is not suppressed merely
        because a person is complicit, and to enable the investigating
        machinery to unravel complex transactions. The law does not compel
        the agency to either prosecute every participant or necessarily tender
        pardon in each case.

   492.                     However, this discretion is neither absolute nor immune
        from judicial scrutiny. It must be exercised in a fair, reasonable and
        non-arbitrary manner, consistent with the mandate of Article 21 and
        the broader principles governing criminal trials. The Hon’ble Supreme
        Court, in Laxmipat Choraria (supra) and later in A.R. Antulay (supra)
        as followed in R. Dineshkumar @ Deena (supra), has recognised the
        permissibility of examining a participes criminis as a prosecution
        witness. At the same time, the Court has been careful to underscore
        that such evidence does not assume the character of independent
        statement. It must have been borne in the mind of the Supreme Court
        that such discretion, if left unchecked, could be misused by the
        investigating agency; it is for this reason that the Court has
        consistently held that the caution applicable to accomplice evidence
        must equally govern the appreciation of statement given by such
        witnesses.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 247 of 549
   493.                     The law is explicit that the evidentiary value of such a
        witness is that of accomplice evidence. Even if the witness is not
        formally declared an approver, once he implicates himself in the
        commission of the offence, his statement stands on the same footing
        as that of an accomplice. It must, therefore, be received with the
        caution traditionally attached to accomplice statement. The rule of
        prudence, requiring independent corroboration on material particulars,
        comes into play. Trial Court is required to scrutinise such evidence
        with care, mindful of the possibility of self-exculpation, shifting of
        blame, or inducement.

   494.                     The jurisprudential concern underlying these precedents
        is evident. While the investigative agency must not be hamstrung in
        unearthing the truth, the criminal process cannot be structured in a
        manner that allows a self-confessed participant to escape the rigour of
        prosecution              while   simultaneously   furnishing   the      primary
        incriminating material against others, and yet be accorded the
        evidentiary stature of a neutral observer. To treat such statement as
        independent evidence would dilute the safeguards built into the law of
        evidence and would disturb the balance between effective
        investigation and a fair trial.

                                                                 (emphasis supplied)

   495.                     The basis for treating such statement with caution lies
        not in the description given by the prosecution, but in the nature of the
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 248 of 549
        evidence itself. When a witness admits his own involvement in the
        alleged offence and at the same time seeks to implicate others, his
        statement is necessarily affected by self-interest. Merely examining
        him as a general witness does not remove the taint arising from his
        admitted participation. Unlike an approver who is tendered pardon
        through a statutory process and remains subject to the consequences
        of any deviation from full and truthful disclosure, a self-confessed
        participant examined as an ordinary witness does not undergo similar
        safeguards. In such circumstances, the possibility of aligning his
        version with the prosecution to secure protection for himself cannot be
        ruled out. For this reason, the settled rule of prudence requires that his
        evidence be approached with the same caution as accomplice evidence
        and that it be relied upon only if there is independent corroboration on
        material particulars connecting the accused with the alleged offence.

   496.                   Accordingly, the statements of witnesses who incriminate
        themselves, though examined as prosecution witnesses, cannot be
        elevated to the status of independent evidence. Their statement must
        be approached with circumspection and must find assurance from
        independent corroborative material before it can be acted upon. Any
        failure to apply this settled principle would amount to a clear
        misdirection in law.

   497.                     The prosecution has attempted to support the statement
        of PW-225 by relying upon the statement of approver PW-226. This

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 249 of 549
        raises a basic question in the law of evidence: whether the statement
        of one accomplice-like witness can be treated as corroborated merely
        because it is supported by another accomplice or approver.

   498.                     On the material placed before the Court, the position is
        straightforward. PW-226 does not claim to have personally witnessed
        the alleged meeting between PW-225 and A-18. His version, insofar
        as it concerns that meeting, is based on what was allegedly told to him
        by PW-225. To that extent, his statement is hearsay and cannot
        constitute independent corroboration. Corroboration in law must come
        from a source independent of the witness whose statement is sought to
        be strengthened.

   499.                     The matter assumes further significance because
        PW-225 himself has stated that 10 to 12 persons were present at the
        time of the alleged meeting with A-18. Those persons were
        independent witnesses who, if examined, could have provided direct
        evidence as to what transpired. Their statements are not before the
        Court. It is not known whether they were never examined or whether
        they were examined but did not support the prosecution case. In either
        situation, the absence statement of such independent witnesses creates
        a serious gap.

   500.                     Even if the prosecution seeks to rely upon certain
        surrounding circumstances referred to by PW-226 as corroboration on
        material particulars, the legal difficulty remains. The question is
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 250 of 549
        whether PW-225 can be treated as an independent source to
        corroborate PW-226, or vice versa. The answer must be in the
        negative. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in K. Hashim (supra), followed
        in Somasundaram (supra), has reiterated the settled principle that one
        accomplice cannot corroborate another. Corroboration must be
        independent. No exceptional circumstance has been pointed out by the
        prosecution to justify departure from this settled rule.

   501.                     The charge-sheet further records that A-18 had stated
        that PW-225 had come to meet him regarding allotment of land in
        Delhi for a trust, and that this explanation was found to be false on the
        basis of PW-225’s statement. At this stage, the defence version cannot
        be evaluated. However, the only direct assertion connecting A-18 to
        the alleged conspiracy, namely, the alleged statement that A-17 would
        call in that regard, rests solely on the uncorroborated statement of
        PW-225. The admitted presence of public persons during the
        conversation, coupled with their non-examination, leaves no material
        on record to bring the case within any recognised exception.

   502.                     This assumes added importance because the alleged
        conversation was capable of direct verification through the very
        persons stated to be present. In the absence of such independent
        evidence, the prosecution case rests on one accomplice-like statement
        being supported by another. In law, such mutual reliance does not
        amount to corroboration.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 251 of 549
   503.                     Accordingly, the statement said to directly connect A-18
        remains absolutely uncorroborated by independent evidence. In the
        absence of such corroboration, it cannot be treated as sufficient to
        sustain the allegation.

   504.                     Upon consideration of the material placed on record, this
        Court finds that, as already discussed while examining the role of A-8,
        the prosecution has failed to establish even a prima facie case of
        manipulation of the policy. The clauses incorporated in the policy
        cannot be traced to any document allegedly supplied by the so-called
        South Group. The record reflects deliberations at various levels,
        examination by the competent authorities, and a progressive
        development of the policy framework, culminating in approval by the
        Hon’ble LG. No material has been shown to suggest any prior
        agreement or meeting of minds indicative of a criminal conspiracy in
        the formulation of the policy.

   505.                     If the principal allegation against the Deputy Chief
        Minister (A-8) does not withstand scrutiny, the attempt to fasten a
        peripheral role upon Chief Minister (A-18) cannot independently
        survive. The allegation against A-18 rests primarily on a solitary line
        in the statement of PW-225, an accomplice-like witness, stating that
        A-17 would be contacting him. The said statement is alleged to have
        been made in the presence of 10 to 12 persons. Those persons were
        admittedly present; however, they have either not been examined or, if

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 252 of 549
        examined, have not been cited as witnesses in the charge-sheet. The
        absence of such independent version raises serious concerns regarding
        the completeness and fairness of the investigation. Where direct
        witnesses are available, reliance on a tainted source cannot
        compensate for their non-production.

   506.                     The prosecution proceeds on the premise that the policy
        was manipulated pursuant to a criminal design. If that foundation is
        not established, the subsequent allegations necessarily lose their
        footing. A prosecution cannot be sustained by isolating a fragment and
        elevating it into a circumstance of a larger conspiracy without first
        proving the core allegation.

   507.                     A scrutiny of the record further reveals that no
        contemporaneous document, file noting, electronic communication,
        financial transaction or digital evidence has been produced to directly
        or indirectly connect A-18 with any alleged policy manipulation or
        illegal gratification. There is no material to show his presence at any
        conspiratorial meeting or to indicate his knowledge of any unlawful
        arrangement. The attempt to implicate him rests on inference drawn
        from uncorroborated accomplice-like statement.

   508.                     It is also noteworthy that PW-20, the prosecution’s
        approver whose seven statements are relied upon and who claims
        knowledge from the stage of policy formulation to the alleged
        utilisation of funds, has not attributed any role to A-18. PW-20 has
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 253 of 549
        assigned roles to several other accused persons. There appears no
        reason why, if any involvement of A-18 existed within his knowledge,
        the same would not have been disclosed. His silence in this regard
        assumes significance and further weakens the case sought to be made
        against A-18.

   509.                     The mere invocation of the expression “conspiracy” does
        not dispense with the requirement of material indicating agreement
        and participation. Criminal liability cannot be inferred from the office
        held or from suspicion. In the absence of admissible material, and
        where the connection is sought to be established solely through
        uncorroborated tainted statements, the threshold required even at the
        stage of charge is not satisfied. Reliance is place upon the judgment of
        Hon’ble Supreme Court in Suresh Budharmal Kalani (supra).

   510.                 The right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the
        Constitution mandates that every prosecution must rest upon a fair,
        objective and complete investigation. A fair trial is inseparable from a
        fair investigation. When independent material is available but not
        placed before the Court, and reliance is placed instead upon selective
        fragments of inculpatory statements, the constitutional guarantee is put
        at risk. The liberty and reputation of an individual cannot be imperilled
        on the basis of conjecture or unsupported inference. Criminal
        proceedings are intended to adjudicate facts in accordance with law,
        not to proceed upon speculative allegations.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 254 of 549
                                                              (emphasis supplied)

   511.                     If persons are implicated without cogent and legally
        admissible material, the effect would be to allow the investigating
        agency, rather than the Court, to determine their fate. Such a course is
        inconsistent with the rule of law. Serious allegations must be supported
        by admissible material. In the absence of foundational material
        connecting A-18 with any criminal design, and in the absence of
        independent corroboration of the statements of accomplice like
        witness, relied upon, the attribution of a central conspiratorial role
        cannot be sustained.

   512.                     The consequences are even more serious where the
        person concerned holds a constitutional office. Arrest and prosecution
        in such circumstances have implications beyond the individual. Public
        confidence in institutions is inevitably affected. If it is later found that
        such prosecution was unsupported by admissible material, the erosion
        of public trust is substantial. The power to investigate and prosecute
        carries with it a corresponding obligation of fairness, restraint and
        adherence to rule of evidence. Only by strict observance of these
        principles can both individual liberty and public faith in the justice
        system be preserved.

   513.                     Resultantly, when the statement of PW-225 is evaluated
        in its correct legal character, as a self-incriminating, participant-
        account akin to that of an approver, and tested against the complete
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 255 of 549
        absence of independent corroboration on the sole material link
        attributed to A-18, the Court finds that such uncorroborated statement
        cannot, even at the threshold stage, constitute a legally sustainable
        basis to proceed against A-18.

        Failure of Case Against Public Servants — Nonetheless, Examination
        of Other Accused Continues

   514.                     The prosecution seeks to portray A-8, the then Deputy
        Chief Minister, as the principal architect of the DEP-21/22. It is
        alleged that he constituted the Ravi Dhawan Committee, chaired the
        GoM, brought about structural changes by privatising the wholesale
        segment, fixed the wholesale margin at 12%, and structured the policy
        in a manner intended to recoup alleged upfront payments of about
        ₹90–100 crores, thereby laying the groundwork for the supposed
        conspiracy. It is further alleged that illegal gratification was paid to
        A-2 for facilitating the grant of licence to M/S Indospirit, and that such
        licence was ultimately granted by A-1. The Chief Minister (A-18) is
        projected as the central figure who orchestrated the overall design.

   515.                     However, for reasons already recorded, when these
        allegations are examined in the light of the material placed on record,
        they are reduced to inferences not supported by admissible material.
        The links said to form the chain of conspiracy are not borne out from
        contemporaneous official notings, departmental records, or any
        independent documentary material. There is no demonstrable nexus
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 256 of 549
        between the features of the policy and the alleged recoupment theory.
        The prosecution case, insofar as it seeks to attribute criminal
        culpability to public servants under the PC Act, 1988 thus remains
        without foundational material.

   516.                     It must be emphasised that unless there is material
        indicating demand, acceptance, or conscious abuse of official position
        for obtaining pecuniary advantage, the essential ingredients of
        offences under the PC Act cannot be said to exist. In the absence of
        such material, the very basis for proceeding against public servants
        under the said enactment stands eroded.

   517.                     Be that as it may, and in order to examine the matter in
        its entirety, this Court deems it appropriate to proceed further on the
        assumption, without so holding, that the prosecution case survives
        scrutiny against the public servants. Proceeding on that hypothesis, it
        becomes necessary to consider whether the material on record
        discloses sufficient grounds to frame charges against the private
        accused persons who are alleged to have acted in concert.

   518.                     The discussion shall now move to the second category
        of accused persons, examined role-wise for the sake of clarity and
        coherence. The enquiry shall remain confined to the limited test
        applicable at the stage of framing of charge, namely whether the
        material gives rise to grave suspicion based on admissible evidence,


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 257 of 549
        or whether it rests merely on conjecture insufficient to warrant a
        criminal trial.

        Allegation against A-3

   519.                     The prosecution projects A-3, Vijay Nair, as the central
        facilitator and operational fulcrum of the alleged criminal conspiracy
        concerning the formulation and implementation of the DEP-21/22.
        Though not holding any formal office in the Government of NCT of
        Delhi, he is alleged to have exercised de facto influence by reason of
        his proximity to the political executive, particularly Accused Manish
        Sisodia (A-8) and other senior functionaries, and to have functioned
        as the principal intermediary between public servants and private
        liquor businessmen described as the “South Group”.

   520.                     It is alleged that A-3 convened, attended and coordinated
        crucial meetings-inter alia at Gauri Apartments, New Delhi, and at ITC
        Kohenoor, Hyderabad-where the prosecution claims the contours of
        the conspiracy were crystallised, including the alleged demand,
        arrangement and quantification of illegal gratification aggregating
        approximately Rs. 90-100 crores. According to the prosecution, he
        negotiated and facilitated advance payments of Rs. 20-30 crores
        through hawala channels, and thereafter played a coordinating role in
        the generation, collection and recovery of illicit funds through
        favoured wholesalers, including M/S Indospirits and M/S BSPL.


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 258 of 549
   521.                     The prosecution further alleges that A-3 ensured that key
        policy features-such as the uniform 12% wholesale margin, the “one
        wholesaler per manufacturer” model, the zoning of retail vends, and
        the use of credit-note mechanisms-were operationalised in a manner
        advantageous to the alleged conspirators. He is also attributed a
        supervisory role in the routing, layering and diversion of the alleged
        proceeds of crime through commercial, media and intermediary
        entities, as well as in coordinating the political utilisation of such
        funds, including for the Goa Assembly Elections, 2022.

   522.                     On this foundation, the prosecution asserts that the
        conduct attributed to A-3 discloses continuity of involvement,
        conscious facilitation and requisite mens rea, portraying him as a key
        non-official architect and executor of the alleged conspiracy
        underlying the DEP-21/22.

        Analysis

        (a) Meeting at Gauri Apartments

   523.                     The prosecution seeks to attribute the genesis of the
        alleged criminal conspiracy relating to the formulation and
        implementation of the DEP-21/22 to an interaction stated to have
        taken place in May 2021 at Gauri Apartments, involving Vijay Nair
        (A-3), Arjun Pandey (A-10), Dinesh Arora (PW-20), Sikander Maan
        (PW-20), his nephew Virat Maan (PW-1), Abhishek Boinpally (A-4),


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 259 of 549
        A.R. Pillai (A-5) and Butchi Babu (A-11), and to portray the said
        interaction as a precursor to the subsequent meeting at ITC Kohinoor,
        Hyderabad. In support of this assertion, reliance has been placed upon
        the statement of the approver Dinesh Arora (PW-20), read with the
        statements of PW-1 and PW-2. The prosecution further attempts to
        locate the origin of the alleged conspiracy in meeting purportedly held
        at Flat No. 2, 3/4, Gauri Apartment, Rajesh Pilot Lane, New Delhi, an
        allegation founded on the statements of PW-41 (Cook), PW-42
        (Caretaker) and PW-43 (Sh. Rajiv Singh, Additional Advocate
        General), which therefore falls for close scrutiny at the threshold.

   524.                     A conjoint reading of the statements of PW-1 Virat
        Maan, PW-2 Sikander Maan, and the approver Dinesh Arora (PW-20)
        does not support the prosecution’s attempt to characterise the alleged
        May 2021 interaction as conspiratorial. What runs as a common thread
        through the statements of the aforesaid witnesses is the assertion that
        the members of the so-called “South Group” were contemplating the
        acquisition of five to ten retail zones, and that PW-1 and PW-2 could
        assist them in setting up the shops and providing staff for running the
        shops. In return, it is stated, assistance would be extended to promote
        their brand “Royal Green” at such outlets, and to facilitate the sale of
        the said brand in the Telangana market. The tenor of these statements
        unmistakably suggests that the intention attributed to the South Group



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                     Page no. 260 of 549
        members was to enter the retail liquor business, to secure retail
        zones, and to arrange manpower if and when such entry materialised.

   525.                     At this stage, it assumes significance to note that PW-20,
        in his confessional statement recorded under Section 164 of Cr.P.C.
        prior to the grant of pardon, has nowhere stated that the members of
        the South Group were inclined to take five to ten retail zones. This
        assertion emerges only subsequently, in the statement recorded under
        Section 306(4) of Cr.P.C. after the grant of pardon, wherein PW-20
        introduces the version that the South Group was inclined to take five
        to ten zones. The belated introduction of this detail, after the grant of
        pardon, when contrasted with the earlier silence, is a circumstance
        which bears directly on the probative worth of the version now sought
        to be relied upon.

   526.                     It also bears emphasis that the investigating agency has
        not disputed the tender process, nor has it alleged any undue favour or
        irregularity in the allotment of retail zones. The integrity of the tender
        mechanism and the legitimacy of participation in the retail excise
        business thus stand undisputed on the prosecution’s own showing.

                                                                 (emphasis supplied)

   527.                     Equally relevant is the admitted position that PW-1 and
        PW-2 are themselves deeply associated with the liquor business. PW-2
        has categorically stated that he is the manufacturer of the brand


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 261 of 549
        “Royal Green” and has further admitted that he is running nearly 60
        retail outlets in the State of Haryana. Despite this admitted commercial
        positioning, the prosecution does not allege any criminal conspiracy
        against PW-1 or PW-2. On the contrary, it is apparent from the record
        that PW-2, being a manufacturer associated with M/S ADS Spirits
        Private Limited, was seeking to push his own brand by proposing to
        place his staff and manpower at the retail zones which the alleged
        “South Group” proposed to operate.

   528.                     A careful reading of the statements of PW-1 and PW-2
        also reveals that the arrangements spoken of by them, particularly with
        regard to placement of staff and operational control, were, if
        anything, contrary to the stated objectives of the DEP-21/22.
        Significantly, it was PW-20 who arranged the meeting at Gauri
        Apartment, and the material on record indicates that his proximity with
        PW-2 was far closer than with the accused persons who are alleged
        to have been present at the said meeting.

   529.                     At this juncture, a hypothetical reversal of roles exposes
        the inherent asymmetry in the prosecution’s approach. Had the South
        Group members been examined as witnesses, and PW-1, PW-2 and
        PW-20 been placed in the dock, and had the accused persons deposed
        to the facts now disclosed by these PWs, it would have been
        exceedingly difficult for PW-1, PW-2 and PW-20 to contend that they
        were not acting in concert, or that they were not seeking coordinated

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 262 of 549
        assistance to facilitate their commercial objectives. The conduct
        attributed to them, discussions on zones, manpower, branding, staffing
        and operational support, would, in such a scenario, readily lend itself
        to an inference of concerted action.

   530.                     It also merits notice that these PWs, except PW-2,
        admittedly attended the subsequent meeting at ITC Kohinoor,
        Hyderabad, and travelled from Delhi for the said meeting. This
        continued engagement, movement, and participation at successive
        meetings underscores that the witnesses themselves were active
        participants in the commercial discussions, rather than passive
        bystanders or mere recipients of proposals.

   531.                     The act of seeking manpower or operational assistance
        for running retail zones, by itself, does not constitute an illegal act, nor
        is there any material to suggest that such arrangements were sought to
        be effected through illegal means. Quite paradoxically, the witnesses
        who speak of facts having a self-incriminating character are projected
        as prosecution witnesses, while the accused persons are sought to be
        implicated on the basis of such statements. When the meeting at Gauri
        Apartment is examined in isolation, the material placed on record, at
        best, reflects an attempt by certain individuals to explore participation
        in the Delhi excise business, a commercial activity which, per se, is
        lawful and permissible under the policy framework.

                                                             (emphasis supplied)
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 263 of 549
   532.                     It is also of significance that the witnesses have
        categorically stated that A-11 (Butchi Babu) was enquiring about the
        financial contours of the Delhi liquor market. The precise extract, as
        appearing in the record, reads as under: “Sh Butchi Babu was mainly
        asking the questions about financial aspects of the business that how
        is the Delhi market , how we can make profits .”

   533.                     This aspect assumes considerable importance when
        juxtaposed with the prosecution’s own narrative. On the one hand, the
        record reflects that in May 2021, A-11 was making elementary
        enquiries regarding the Delhi market, its profitability, operational
        contours, and commercial viability. On the other hand, the
        investigating agency projects that as early as March 2021, a sum of
        ₹10 crores out of an alleged upfront demand of ₹100 crores had
        already been delivered by the approver Raghav Magunta (PW-226),
        purportedly at the instance of A-17, out of a total projected figure of
        ₹25 crores.

   534.                     If the prosecution version were to be accepted at face
        value, it would necessarily imply that the payment of “upfront
        money” had already been crystallised, agreed upon, and partially
        executed by March 2021. Yet, the contemporaneous conduct attributed
        to A-4, A-5 and A-11, who are themselves projected as conduits of
        A-17 (K. Kavitha), reveals that they were still grappling with
        foundational questions: how retail operations would be staffed, how

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 264 of 549
        shops would be set up, and whether the Delhi market was even
        commercially viable.

                                                                 (emphasis supplied)

   535.                     This internal inconsistency strikes at the very root of the
        prosecution theory. Viewed cumulatively, the conversations and
        statements relied upon by the prosecution disclose, at best, exploratory
        commercial discussions surrounding a lawful business activity. They
        stand in clear contradiction to the theory of a pre-meditated and
        concluded criminal conspiracy, and the prosecution’s own material,
        therefore, undermines rather than advances the case sought to be
        projected.

   536.                     The statements of all three witnesses uniformly indicate
        that the conversations, as described by them, were confined to private
        commercial engagements among businessmen, relating to exploration
        of prospective participation in the retail segment under the DEP-21/22.
        None of these witnesses attributes any role to a Government
        functionary, nor do they speak of any discussion concerning policy
        formulation, file movement, official approvals, unlawful gratification
        or quid pro quo. Of particular relevance is the categorical statement of
        PW-1 Virat Maan, who has stated that “Vijay Nair and Ashok Pandey
        did not speak in that meeting but they were listening.” This assertion
        clearly indicates that neither Vijay Nair nor Arjun Pandey were active
        participants in any discussion, much less in any alleged conspiratorial
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 265 of 549
        deliberation. Mere presence, without attribution of any incriminating
        act or role, cannot be elevated to an inference of conspiracy.

   537.                     Even if one were to assume, for the sake of argument,
        that the prosecution case is stretched to its fullest amplitude, there
        remains no material to indicate that any criminal design or conspiracy
        was ever discussed, conceived, or agreed upon in the manner alleged.
        The foundational element of a meeting of minds continues to remain
        absent from the record.

   538.                     Even otherwise, a significant evidentiary hurdle
        confronts the prosecution. When viewed in their proper legal
        perspective, the statements of PW-1 and PW-2 partake the character of
        accomplice-like statement. Their versions, by their very nature,
        require independent corroboration on material particulars before they
        can be relied upon. PW-20, having been tendered pardon and
        examined as an approver, stands on the same footing so far as the rule
        of corroboration is concerned. His statement, though admissible,
        cannot be acted upon without independent assurance.

   539.                     It has already been discussed in detail in the earlier
        paragraphs that one accomplice cannot corroborate another so as to
        lend credence to the approver’s version. Corroboration, in law, must
        emanate from an independent and reliable source, and not from a
        witness who is himself tainted by participation or interested
        involvement in the alleged transaction. Reliance is placed upon the
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 266 of 549
        judgments of Hon’ble Supreme Court in K. Hashim (supra),
        Somasundaram (supra), Laxmipat Choraria (supra) and A.R. Antulay
        (supra).

   540.                     The prosecution seeks to draw support from three other
        witnesses who could, in theory, furnish independent corroboration.
        However, upon a careful reading of the statements of PW-41, PW-42
        and PW-43, it becomes evident that their statements do not advance
        the prosecution case in this regard. Their evidence, which shall now
        be examined below, does not supply the requisite independent
        corroboration on material particulars so as to strengthen the
        accomplice-like versions relied upon by the prosecution.

   541.                      The prosecution’s alternative narrative, that the genesis
        of the conspiracy lies in meetings at Gauri Apartment, rests on the
        statements of PW-41 (the cook posted at the Uttam Galva Steels guest
        house), PW-42 (the caretaker of the premises), and PW-43 (Shri Rajiv
        Singh, Additional Advocate General). On a careful and conjoint
        appreciation of their statements, the Court finds that the entire body of
        material relating to the stay of certain individuals at the said premises
        is routine, peripheral, and wholly unconnected with the formulation or
        implementation of the DEP-21/22. PW-41 and PW-42 merely depose
        to the fact that accommodation was provided at the premises. PW-41
        states that A-3 (Vijay Nair) stayed there for two to three days in March
        2020, while PW-42 deposes that one “known person of Shri Vibhav,”

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 267 of 549
        later identified as Shri Durgesh Pathak, MLA, stayed there in May
        2021 for over a month. Crucially, neither witness speaks of having
        seen, heard, or participated in any discussion touching upon excise
        policy. They do not describe the presence of any excise official, public
        servant, manufacturer, wholesaler, or stakeholder connected with the
        policy regime, nor do they refer to any meeting or interaction of
        relevance to the alleged conspiracy. The statement of PW-43 does not
        advance the prosecution case any further. He merely states that he
        arranged accommodation at the request of Shri Vibhav Kumar, PS to
        the Chief Minister (“I was contacted telephonically…who requested
        to accommodate Shri Vijay Nair”), and that he later learnt from the
        caretaker that “the person who stayed… was Shri Durgesh Pathak,
        MLA… and he stayed there for more than a month.” His solitary
        assertion that Shri Pathak “was facilitating various meetings including
        meeting attended by accused Vijay Nair” is expressly based on what
        “was informed to me by the caretaker”, rendering the statement
        hearsay, devoid of personal knowledge, and incapable in law of
        sustaining any inference of conspiracy.

   542.                     Significantly, none of the witnesses, PW-41, PW-42 or
        PW-43, describes any meeting pertaining to the Excise Policy, any
        interaction          with   excise   officials,   any   communication        with
        manufacturers or wholesalers, or any conduct suggestive of quid pro
        quo. There is no evidence, either direct or circumstantial, of any

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 268 of 549
        policy-related deliberation, decision-making, or unlawful agreement
        having taken place at the said premises. Viewed at its highest, the
        material on record establishes no more than that certain private
        individuals were temporarily accommodated at a corporate guest
        house on personal request. The evidence does not disclose any nexus,
        either direct or inferential, between such accommodation and the
        alleged corruption in the drafting or execution of the DEP-21/22. The
        prosecution’s attempt to treat the alleged meeting or stay at Gauri
        Apartments as the genesis of a criminal conspiracy is, therefore,
        unsupported by admissible evidence and rests on conjecture rather
        than admissible material.

        (b) Absence of Coercion by A-3 in PRI’s Appointment of Indospirits

   543.                     The allegation that A-3 employed coercion or force to
        compel Pernod Ricard India (PRI) to appoint M/S Indospirit as its
        distributor cannot be examined on the basis of generalised assertions
        or in the abstract. An allegation of this nature necessarily calls for a
        clear and specific inquiry into the manner in which such coercion is
        alleged to have been exercised. It must be shown, with some degree of
        precision, as to how any arm-twisting was undertaken, what position
        of dominance, administrative, regulatory, or otherwise, was allegedly
        wielded, and in what manner such position translated into compulsion
        upon M/S PRI.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 269 of 549
   544.                      In this context, the scrutiny of the charge must rest on
        the statements of the officials of M/S PRI who were directly associated
        with, or competent to speak on, the process of distributor selection and
        whose statements are relied upon by the prosecution. Unless these
        depositions disclose the existence of a position of dominance, the
        mode of its exercise, and a discernible nexus between the alleged
        pressure and the appointment of M/S Indospirit, the allegation cannot
        travel beyond the realm of conjecture. A contextual and complete
        reading         of       the   said   statements,   when   tested   against         the
        contemporaneous documentary record, is therefore essential to
        determine whether any element of coercion is made out or whether the
        appointment of M/S Indospirit was the result of an independent
        commercial decision taken in the ordinary course of business.

   545.                          At the threshold, PW-17 unequivocally clarifies the
        status of A-3 by stating that “he was neither any officer from the
        Excise Department nor was holding any official post”, a circumstance
        which substantially weakens any suggestion of enforceable authority
        or coercive capacity. The witness further records that when Vijay Nair
        (A-3) expressed a desire to meet M/S PRI’s internal decision-maker,
        “we decided not to meet him”, expressly because he held no official
        position, demonstrating that M/S PRI did not regard him as someone
        capable of directing or compelling corporate decisions. The substance
        of Vijay Nair’s communications, as deposed by PW-17, also falls short

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                              Page no. 270 of 549
        of coercion. The Signal message dated 09.08.2021, “Plan you
        suggested may be complete no go. Everyone is against it. Zero trust
        basically”, is explained by the witness as an expression of disapproval
        regarding the proposed appointment of M/S BSPL as L-1, and not as
        any directive to appoint M/S Indospirits. Even during the subsequent
        meeting in Mumbai on 15.08.2021, PW-17 categorically states that
        Vijay Nair “did not suggest the name of any particular party to be
        appointed as L-1, but asked to appoint the L-1 quickly” . The absence
        of any naming or insistence upon M/S Indospirits is a significant
        omission which directly undermines the prosecution’s theory of a pre-
        ordained or forced selection.

   546.                     Equally telling is the fact that M/S PRI’s own conduct
        did not change in response to Vijay Nair’s stated views. PW-17
        expressly states that, despite Nair’s disagreement, “M/S Pernod
        Ricard India Private Limited decided to go ahead with its deal with
        M/S Brindco Sales Private Limited”. The eventual collapse of the M/S
        BSPL arrangement is attributed by the witness not to any pressure or
        intervention by Vijay Nair, but to Brindco’s own commercial refusal,
        as “on 24.08.2021, Sh. Amandeep Singh Dhall informed that he does
        not agree to the commercial terms offered”, followed by a
        confirmatory email dated 23.08.2021, which is D-18. This sequence,
        as narrated by PW-17, establishes that M/S PRI was prepared to persist
        with M/S BSPL notwithstanding Nair’s views, and that the shift away

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 271 of 549
        from        Brindco       was   triggered   by    independent    commercial
        considerations.

   547.                     The allegation of coercion attributed to A-3 is further
        rendered untenable when examined in the light of the statutory
        framework governing wholesale distribution under the excise regime.
        Clause 3.1.1(v) of the DEP-21/22 expressly provides as follows:

                “...Any manufacturer that wishes to sell its products in Delhi
                will have to choose one of licensed L-1 distributor holding
                wholesale license for supply of Indian and foreign liquor and
                also holding bonded warehouse licenses in the form of L-31 as
                an exclusive distributor, for all its brands….”.
   548.                     A plain and literal reading of the aforesaid clause makes
        it abundantly clear that the policy mandates exclusivity at the
        wholesale level, permitting a manufacturer to operate through only one
        L-1 distributor for all its brands. Once a manufacturer has exercised
        such choice, the policy itself forecloses the possibility of parallel or
        multiple wholesale arrangements.

   549.                     In this backdrop, once another manufacturer, namely
        Diageo, had already chosen M/S BSPL as its L-1 distributor, the policy
        framework left no scope for M/S PRI to appoint M/S BSPL as its
        distributor as well. M/S PRI was, therefore, required, by operation of
        the policy itself, to identify and appoint an alternative L-1 distributor.
        This consequence flows directly from the policy mandate and not from
        any external pressure or intervention.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 272 of 549
   550.                     Viewed thus, the suggestion attributed to A-3, even if
        accepted at face value, cannot be characterised as coercive or
        extraneous. On the contrary, such a suggestion stands wholly aligned
        with, and is a logical corollary of, the exclusivity requirement
        embodied in Clause 3.1.1(v) of the applicable excise policy. The
        decision-making space of PRI was already circumscribed by the
        statutory policy framework, and the eventual necessity to explore a
        different distributor arose from policy compliance rather than from
        any alleged compulsion.

                                                              (emphasis supplied)

   551.                     Accordingly, the material on record demonstrates that
        the non-appointment of M/S BSPL by M/S PRI was dictated by the
        operative clauses of the DEP-21/22 itself. Any suggestion or opinion
        expressed by A-3 in this regard merely mirrored the policy position
        and does not, either in law or on facts, disclose any element of
        coercion, pressure, or undue influence.

   552.                     When M/S Indospirits was thereafter considered, PW-17
        makes it explicit that it was not M/S PRI’s first choice. He states that,
        despite a long association, Sameer Mahendru “always had a liquidity
        issue… therefore he was not our first choice”. M/S Indospirits was
        taken up only as a “next best option” after M/S BSPL declined, and
        even then, only upon stringent financial safeguards. PW-17 records
        that M/S PRI insisted that M/S Indospirits “must provide… a bank
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 273 of 549
        guarantee of 100 crores”, and when this was delayed, accepted
        substantial personal sureties running into hundreds of crores. The
        detailed description of the meeting dated 20.09.2021 at Hotel Taj
        Mahal, clarified again in the statement dated 10.05.2024, shows that
        the purpose was “to show his financial ability”, and that the investors
        “confirmed… that they are backing M/S Indospirits for its wholesale
        liquor business in Delhi”. The organisation, booking, and payment of
        this meeting by M/S PRI itself further reinforce that the decision-
        making process was internally driven and commercially evaluated.

   553.                     In this evidentiary backdrop, PW-17’s statement does
        not disclose any act of coercion, compulsion, or dictated outcome
        attributable to A-3. At its highest, the evidence shows that A-3
        expressed opposition to M/S BSPL and urged the expeditious
        appointment of an alternative wholesaler, without naming M/S
        Indospirits, without possessing any official authority, and without
        altering M/S PRI’s initial commercial course. The eventual
        appointment of M/S Indospirits, as per the witness, flowed from M/S
        BSPL withdrawal and from M/S PRI’s own assessment of liquidity
        backing and risk mitigation, not from any pressure exerted by A-3.

   554.                     On a cumulative and contextual reading of the statement
        of PW-17 (Benoy Babu), working as General Manager, M/S Pernod
        Ricard India Pvt. Ltd., recorded on 01.09.2022, 02.11.2022 and
        10.05.2024, the prosecution’s allegation that A-3, coerced or forced

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 274 of 549
        M/S PRI to appoint M/S Indospirits as its L-1 wholesaler does not find
        evidentiary support. Consequently, the allegation that A-3 forced PRI
        to appoint M/S Indospirits as part of a larger conspiracy is not borne
        out from the statement of PW-17 relied upon the prosecution.

        (c) Corporate Guarantees furnished by Pernod Ricard India

   555.                     On a cumulative and contextual appreciation of the
        statement of PW-17 (Benoy Babu), particularly his detailed statement
        dated 02.11.2022 read with his statements dated 01.09.2022 and
        10.05.2024, the prosecution’s allegation that A-3 coerced M/S PRI to
        extend corporate guarantees to retail entities so as to confer an undue
        benefit upon Sameer Mahendru (A-7) or the so-called “South
        Group” as part of a larger conspiracy does not find support from the
        statements on record. At the threshold, PW-17 traces the genesis of the
        proposal for corporate guarantees not to any political pressure or extra-
        corporate influence, but to a commercial request initiated by private
        parties themselves, stating that in the last week of May 2021 “Sh.
        Sameer Mahendru (Indospirit), Sh. C. Suri, Sh. Ashok T. Guljarani…
        Sh. Sanjay Jain and Sh. Ajay Malhotra… approached me for financial
        assistance.” He clarifies that upon such approach, he consulted his
        internal superiors, Manoj Rai and Vimal Khanna, and that “based on
        their inputs, a business proposal was prepared by all of us and sent on
        mail,” thereby placing the entire exercise squarely within M/S PRI’s
        internal commercial decision-making framework.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                     Page no. 275 of 549
   556.                     PW-17 further explains that the structure of any financial
        assistance was dictated by the constraints of the DEP-21/22 itself,
        noting that “we had limited options for extending the financial
        assistance since Delhi Excise Policy does not allow the manufacturer
        to participate in retail space.” The evaluation of permissible financial
        mechanisms thereafter proceeded through formal banking channels,
        with the bank outlining available options, “Corporate Guarantee…
        Standby letter of credit… Term Deposit”, and the ultimate decision
        being taken, as PW-17 expressly records, at the higher management
        level, “with the approval of Sh. Rajesh Mishra.” He is categorical that
        the matter was thereafter “being handled by Sh. Vimal Khanna” and
        that he himself “was not party to these deliberations,” underscoring
        that the decision to extend corporate guarantees was a corporate act
        taken by PRI’s senior management after weighing policy compliance,
        commercial risk and banking advice.

   557.                     Equally significant is what PW-17 does not attribute to
        A-3. Nowhere in his statement does PW-17 state that Vijay Nair (A-3)
        suggested, demanded, directed, or even discussed the extension of
        corporate guarantees. On the contrary, when referring to Vijay Nair
        (A-3) elsewhere, PW-17 consistently emphasises that Nair “was
        neither any officer from Excise Department nor was holding any
        official post,” and that M/S PRI consciously declined to treat him as a
        decision-maker, recording that “we decided not to meet him” when he

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 276 of 549
        sought access to internal decision-makers. The subject-matter of
        Nair’s communications, as narrated by PW-17, remained confined to
        expressions of opinion on distributor preference and policy rollout
        timelines; even in that context, PW-17 records that M/S PRI “decided
        to go ahead with its deal with M/S Brindco Sales Pvt. Ltd.” despite
        Nair’s stated disagreement, demonstrating that Nair’s views were
        neither binding nor determinative. The subsequent execution of
        corporate guarantees further negates any theory of targeted or
        conspiratorial benefit. PW-17 describes the process as one involving
        multiple, unrelated retail aspirants, not a single favoured entity, and
        explains that guarantees were extended only after bank scrutiny, board
        authorisation and formal documentation. The guarantees were not
        informal or concealed acts, but part of a transparent banking
        arrangement culminating in loan disbursements for EMD in favour of
        the Excise Commissioner, Delhi.

   558.                     This position is independently corroborated by the
        statements of PW-30 (Shri Priyank Kuchhal) and PW-31 (Shri Ashish
        Misra), both senior officers of HSBC Bank. Their evidence is purely
        ministerial and confined to production and explanation of certified
        banking records. Neither witness discloses any fact suggesting that the
        execution of corporate guarantees, the sanction of loan facilities, or the
        utilisation and repayment of funds bore any nexus with the
        formulation, modification or implementation of the DEP-21/22, or

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 277 of 549
        with the conduct of any public servant. PW-30 categorically states that
        the credit facilities were sanctioned “for funding of EMD for bidding
        with Excise Department, GNCTD,” and PW-31 confirms that the
        funds were utilised through demand drafts issued in favour of the
        Excise Commissioner, ordinary commercial banking transactions
        undertaken to meet statutory tender requirements. Neither witness
        refers to any communication, direction or involvement of A-3 or any
        public authority. Significantly, no official of M/S PRI has been
        arraigned as an accused, and none of the company’s officers examined
        has alleged any pressure, coercion or inducement by A-3 or by any
        public functionary. In this evidentiary backdrop, the material on record
        establishes that the corporate guarantees were the outcome of
        commercial requests, internal corporate evaluation, policy-driven
        constraints, banking advice and senior-management approval, and not
        the product of any coercion, inducement or conspiratorial design. At
        its highest, the evidence discloses an internal corporate decision taken
        in the ordinary course of business to facilitate participation in the retail
        tender process; it does not disclose any act by A-3 compelling M/S
        PRI to extend such guarantees, nor any material suggesting that the
        guarantees were a vehicle to unlawfully benefit Sameer Mahendru
        (A-7) or any alleged “South Group” participant as part of a larger
        conspiracy.

        (d) Allegation of Demand of Bribe by A-3 for Incorporation of
        Favourable Clauses in DEP-21/22

   559.                     The allegation levelled against A-3, is that, during
        interactions with industry stakeholders, he demanded illegal
        gratification for the inclusion of favourable clauses in the DEP-21/22.
        A careful, contextual and holistic scrutiny of the evidence on record,
        however, renders this allegation wholly unsustainable. A plain reading
        of the statement of PW-104, Vinod Giri, Director General of the
        Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (hereinafter
        referred to as “CIABC”) establishes that his evidence is strictly
        confined to his role as an industry representative participating in an
        open, structured and consultative policy-making process. His
        statement does not disclose, even remotely, any circumstance
        suggestive of corruption, quid pro quo or undue influence in the
        formulation or implementation of the DEP-21/22. On the contrary,
        PW-104 categorically affirms that CIABC addressed multiple written
        representations to the Excise Department, the Lieutenant Governor,
        the Chief Minister and the Deputy Chief Minister, raising policy-level
        concerns regarding wholesale margins, cost reimbursement, parity
        between domestic and imported products, zoning structure,
        cartelisation risks and ease of doing business. These representations
        were routed through formal institutional channels, duly documented
        and placed in the public domain, and were plainly in the nature of

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 279 of 549
        stakeholder feedback rather than any covert or extra-institutional
        intervention.

   560.                     Significantly, PW-104’s evidence brings out that CIABC
        consistently cautioned the Government against the risk of monopolies
        and cartelisation arising from the proposed zoning structure,
        particularly where a single entity could be allotted a large cluster of
        vends within one zone. His statement reflects that CIABC’s
        engagement was directed towards seeking safeguards against
        monopolistic practices, over-charging, brand pushing and coercive
        conduct vis-à-vis suppliers, and towards urging corrective measures
        wherever necessary. These concerns were reiterated even after the
        GoM’ recommendations were placed in the public domain, thereby
        negating any suggestion that the industry was seeking to preserve a
        “status quo” or to secure policy concessions through improper
        means.

   561.                  As regards the meeting with A-3 in the first week of April
        2021 at the Oberoi Hotel, Gurugram, PW-104’s statement is clear and
        unequivocal. He states that the meeting was arranged through
        Amandeep Singh Dhall (A-9) and that A-3 introduced himself as being
        associated with the Aam Aadmi Party and as advising the Delhi
        Government on excise policy matters. The discussion, as narrated,
        remained confined to policy concerns already articulated by CIABC
        in its written representations, particularly the apprehension that large

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 280 of 549
        retail zones could facilitate cartelisation and monopolistic behaviour.
        Crucially, PW-104 does not attribute to A-3 any demand for money,
        gratification, donation or benefit of any nature, nor does he suggest
        that any such demand was even obliquely made. On the contrary,
        PW-104 records that while A-3 explained the policy rationale for
        larger zones, namely, ensuring the financial capacity and stability of
        bidders, PW-104 maintained a differing viewpoint and reiterated the
        need for adequate safeguards against monopolisation. Any assurance
        attributed to A-3 was limited to taking measures to prevent
        cartelisation, and any request made by him was confined to seeking
        industry support for the proposed policy framework. There is a
        complete absence of any allegation that such support was sought or
        offered in exchange for money, or that any “status quo” was to be
        maintained through financial consideration.

   562.                     Equally material is PW-104’s categorical statement that,
        following the said meeting, neither A-3 nor any person acting on his
        behalf contacted him again. He further asserts, without ambiguity, that
        CIABC did not make any donation or payment to the Aam Aadmi
        Party or to any individual for securing favourable provisions in the
        Delhi Excise Policy. This aspect of his statement directly contradicts
        and undermines the prosecution narrative sought to be constructed on
        the basis of the alleged handwritten notepad attributed to I.P. Suresh
        Menon (PW-101) and put to PW-103, suggesting that CIABC paid

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 281 of 549
        money to maintain a “status quo”. No such assertion finds any support
        in the statement of PW-104, who was the principal functionary of
        CIABC and the person directly involved in all policy-related
        interactions.

   563.                     When PW-104’s statement is read alongside that of
        PW-101, Secretary General of the International Spirits and Wines
        Association of India, and PW-110, the broader policy context becomes
        unmistakable. The record demonstrates that the pre-existing excise
        regimes, though revenue-generating, were afflicted by structural
        loopholes and systemic inefficiencies, shortcomings expressly
        identified in the Expert Committee Report chaired by Shri Ravi
        Dhawan and echoed in the recommendations of the GoM. These
        deficiencies have not been seriously disputed even by the prosecution,
        whose objections remain confined to selected clauses alleged to
        facilitate cartelisation or monopoly. Beyond this limited challenge, the
        necessity for reform of the earlier framework stands largely
        uncontroverted. The evidence further reveals that revenue accretion
        under the earlier policies had reached a stage of stagnation, with
        increases being driven largely by incremental duty hikes, intensified
        enforcement and periodic price adjustments, rather than by organic
        growth or structural efficiency in the alcobev sector. As reflected in
        PW-101’s statement, the policy framework had exhausted its capacity
        for further meaningful growth in the absence of comprehensive re-

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                    Page no. 282 of 549
        design. This stagnation, coupled with policy liberalisation in
        neighbouring States and the resultant cross-border diversion of
        consumer demand, rendered maintenance of the status quo neither
        economically viable nor administratively sustainable. Within this
        setting, the statements establish that any genuine reform necessarily
        had to address the architecture of the supply chain, particularly at the
        wholesale and retail levels.

   564.                     PW-101’s evidence indicates that while manufacturers
        broadly supported retail privatisation to address consumer-facing
        inefficiencies, superficial or piecemeal interventions would not have
        sufficed. Absent restructuring at the wholesale level, reforms confined
        to retail alone could not have achieved the stated objectives of market
        efficiency, consumer retention or revenue optimisation. The
        restructuring of the wholesaler, retailer framework thus emerges as an
        intrinsic component of systemic correction, not as a targeted favour to
        any individual or entity. It is also relevant that several prosecution
        witnesses are themselves stakeholders within the alcobev industry, and
        their statements naturally reflect commercial perspectives. Yet, when
        read cumulatively, these statements converge on a consistent theme:
        that the DEP-21/22 was shaped by market realities and structural
        policy considerations, and not by any corrupt design or improper
        inducement. Finally, when PW-101’s statement is assessed together
        with the categorical evidence of PW-91, the alleged role attributed to

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 283 of 549
        A-3 is further diluted. PW-91 unequivocally places A-3 as a party
        volunteer, holding no formal post, statutory authority or role in
        governmental decision-making or policy formulation. The record
        discloses no material from which it could be inferred that he exercised
        any determinative, advisory or influential role in the formulation or
        implementation of the DEP-21/22.

   565.                     Moreover, PW-101 has, in his statement, categorically
        stated that the recommendations of the Ravi Dhawan Committee were,
        in principle, acceptable to ISWAI. He has further deposed that, apart
        from the recommendations contained in the said report, ISWAI had
        also forwarded certain additional suggestions which do not find
        mention in the Ravi Dhawan Report. One such suggestion, as
        specifically highlighted by PW-101, was that there should be no price
        comparison with other States and that manufacturers ought to be
        permitted to fix the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of their products.

   566.                     The   very   nature   of   the   aforesaid      suggestion
        unmistakably demonstrates that ISWAI, representing the interests of
        manufacturers, was seeking policy outcomes beneficial to its
        constituents under the proposed excise regime. PW-101 has further
        stated that neither the additional suggestions made by ISWAI nor the
        recommendations of the Ravi Dhawan Committee were ultimately
        accepted. It is well settled that the commercial interests of



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 284 of 549
        manufacturers cannot, either in law or in principle, be equated with the
        interests of the Government or those of the consumer.

   567.                     The statement of PW-101 further reveals that the earlier
        excise policy was, admittedly, favourable to manufacturers, which
        explains their consistent effort to maintain the status quo, as it placed
        them in a dominant and advantageous position enabling effective
        control over the distribution and sale of liquor. Their evident
        dissatisfaction with the DEP-21/22 clearly suggests that their position
        stood diluted by the introduction of private wholesalers, a structural
        reform which was not acceptable to them.

   568.                     It is significant that the investigating agency has, from
        the very inception of the case, maintained that A-8, A-3 and A-18 were
        in favour of the DEP-21/22, particularly the introduction of private
        wholesalers and retailers. Viewed in this backdrop, the reliance placed
        by the prosecution on the statement of PW-101 materially undermines
        the very hypothesis sought to be advanced by the investigating agency,
        namely, that the aforesaid accused persons were opposed to the
        recommendations of the Ravi Dhawan Report and sought to introduce
        policy changes to favour the so-called “South Group”.

   569.                     PW-101 has further stated that A-3 expressed that
        ISWAI may also project favourable media coverage on visual media
        (television), after PW-101 conveyed that ISWAI was supporting the
        Ravi Dhawan Report in print media. In his words: “I also said that
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 285 of 549
        ISWAI could only support the recommendation of the Ravi Dhawan
        Committee through favourable media stories, which we had already
        been doing in print media. On this, Shri Vijay Nair said that he wanted
        favourable media stories on visual media too.” This statement, read in
        its proper context, does not disclose any demand for illegal
        gratification, but merely reflects a request for public articulation and
        media support.

   570.                     If A-3 was, as stated by PW-101, supporting the Ravi
        Dhawan Report, it necessarily follows that he was acting contrary to
        the alleged conspiracy, since the recommendations of the said report
        were not in favour of private wholesalers, which, according to the
        prosecution itself, constitutes the foundational premise for the alleged
        payment of “upfront money”.

                                                            (emphasis supplied)

   571.                     This aspect assumes further significance when read
        alongside PW-101’s own statement that ISWAI was, in fact, desirous
        of a Government-controlled wholesaler. The prosecution case, from its
        inception, proceeds on the assertion that the collection of “upfront
        money” was premised upon, and incentivised by, the privatisation of
        the wholesale segment. The admitted preference of ISWAI for a
        Government wholesaler stands in direct contradiction to this premise.
        Consequently, the prosecution’s attempt to introduce an indirect


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 286 of 549
        demand in the form of “some offer” rests on fundamentally flawed
        assumptions and collapses under its own weight.

                                                             (emphasis supplied)

   572.                     Thus, even on a prima facie evaluation, acceptance of
        the prosecution’s interpretation of the expression “some offer” would
        introduce an internal inconsistency in the prosecution narrative,
        thereby eroding the very foundation concerning the alleged motive,
        object and beneficiaries of the purported conspiracy. The use of the
        expression “offer”, in the context in which it appears, can only be read
        as relating to media support and public articulation, and not to any
        under-hand payment; otherwise, the prosecution case would stand
        vitiated at its very foundation and lose all legal significance.

   573.                     Viewed in its entirety, the evidence of PW-104, read
        conjointly with PW-101 and PW-91, affirmatively establishes that
        industry engagement with the policy process occurred through
        transparent, documented representations and limited stakeholder
        interaction, and that even in the solitary meeting with A-3 there was
        neither a demand nor an offer of any illegal gratification. The
        allegation that A-3 demanded a bribe for incorporation of favourable
        clauses is thus not merely unsubstantiated, but stands squarely
        contradicted by the prosecution’s own evidence, warranting its
        complete rejection at this stage.


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 287 of 549
        Outcome of Evaluation

   574.                     The prosecution attributes a central and pivotal role to
        A-3. He is portrayed as the representative or conduit of A-8, allegedly
        present at various meetings with other accused persons and, by virtue
        of such presence, in a position to influence proceedings or exert
        pressure. According to the prosecution, he figures at every stage of the
        alleged conspiracy, whether in the formulation of the policy, its
        implementation, coordination concerning the alleged upfront amount,
        the purported recoupment thereof, or the indirect coordination of funds
        said to have been channelled to Goa for electoral utilisation.

   575.                     On the prosecution’s own case, his role is described as
        both direct and indirect. It is termed direct in the sense that he is stated
        to have attended meetings and coordinated between parties. At the
        same time, it is indirect because he is not alleged to have personally
        paid any bribe to A-2, nor to have directly received any upfront
        amount. It is not alleged that he derived any identifiable pecuniary
        benefit. His company is not shown to have held any wholesale or retail
        licence under the impugned policy. There is no material to indicate that
        he was a beneficiary of the policy framework in any tangible manner.

   576.                     In these circumstances, it was incumbent upon the
        prosecution to place prima facie foundational facts demonstrating how
        and in what manner A-3 occupied a central position in the alleged
        conspiracy. Mere presence at meetings, even if assumed, does not by
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 288 of 549
        itself establish participation in a criminal design unless supported by
        material reflecting agreement, intention, or overt acts in furtherance
        thereof.

   577.                     In cases of conspiracy, the prosecution may rely upon
        circumstantial           evidence   and   connecting   links   which,       taken
        cumulatively, may indicate a meeting of minds. A certain latitude is
        therefore available at the stage of charge. However, that latitude cannot
        extend to replacing material with conjecture. Where the surrounding
        circumstances clearly reflect coordinated action towards an unlawful
        object, the prosecution’s task is simplified. In the present case,
        however, the foundational premises themselves remain unsupported
        by admissible material.

   578.                     There is no admissible material to show that the
        formulation of the policy was the result of a conspiracy. There is no
        admissible material establishing payment of any bribe. There is no
        material to indicate that wholesale licences were granted in violation
        of the policy framework. In the absence of these cumulative elements,
        the role attributed to A-3 remains unsupported by objective evidence
        and rests on inference.

   579.                     More significantly, the attribution of role to A-3 rests
        substantially on the statement of the approver. It is settled law that a
        charge cannot be founded solely on the uncorroborated statement of
        an approver. At the very least, there must be prima facie corroboration
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 289 of 549
        in material particulars connecting the accused with the alleged offence.
        In the absence of such corroborative material, the prosecution case,
        insofar as it concerns A-3, does not meet the threshold required for
        framing of charge.

        Allegations against A-7

   580.                     The prosecution alleges that A-7, Sameer Mahendru
        (M/S Indospirits), acted as a private beneficiary and facilitator within
        the larger conspiracy relating to the formulation and implementation
        of the DEP-21/22. It is alleged that, pursuant to pre-arranged
        understandings with other private accused and public servants, A-7
        was positioned to secure undue commercial advantage through the
        grant of L-1 wholesale licence in favour of M/S Indospirits. According
        to the prosecution, M/S Indospirits was enabled to emerge as a
        favoured wholesaler for certain manufacturers, particularly PRI,
        allegedly through manipulated processing of licence applications,
        suppression of adverse material, and expedited approvals. It is further
        alleged that A-7 was aware of, and a willing participant in, the broader
        conspiracy involving policy clauses such as wholesaler margins and
        exclusive distribution arrangements, and that the benefits accruing to
        Indospirits were not the result of ordinary commercial selection but
        flowed from a concerted design among the conspirators. The
        prosecution thus projects A-7 as a key private link through whom the

        alleged policy manipulation translated into concrete commercial
        gain.

        Analysis

        (I) Alleged Wholesaler–Retail Cartel, Funding of EMD, and the
        Mahandru/Indospirit Control Theory

   581.                     The prosecution alleges that the so-called Indospirit
        group, purportedly headed by A-7, sought to exercise impermissible
        control over retail zones by funding EMDs, holding ownership
        interests, and thereby creating a wholesaler, retail cartel in violation of
        the object and scheme of the DEP-21/22. This allegation is sought to
        be built primarily around M/S KGRL, M/S Bubbly Beverages Pvt.
        Ltd., and M/S Indospirit Retail Pvt. Ltd., by attributing to them a
        common thread of Mahandru/Indospirit control.

        Evidentiary Assessment

   582.                     The prosuection has relied on the statements of PW-27,
        Shri Arun Kumar Singh (Assistant Registrar of Companies), PW-28,
        Smt. Vimal Khanna (General Manager, Strategic Planning, Pernod
        Ricard India Pvt. Ltd.), and the certified banking records proved
        through PW-34, Ms. Mohini Rane (Deputy Branch Manager, ICICI
        Bank), to establish that the three entities formed part of, or were
        controlled by, the alleged Indospirit/Mahandru group in relation to the
        DEP-21/22.

        Alleged that M/S KGRL was controlled by A-7

        (i) The funding for EMD and application fee

   583.                     The NEP-20/21 was framed with the clear objective of
        dismantling monopolistic structures, preventing cartelisation, and
        introducing a competitive and transparent market regime. To give
        effect to this objective, the policy itself incorporated specific
        safeguards, including the concept of “related entities”, as expressly
        defined in the relevant clause. The policy thus consciously set out the
        precise circumstances in which common ownership or control would
        attract disqualification, while equally demarcating what conduct
        would remain permissible.

   584.                     The prosecution seeks to build an allegation on the
        footing that the EMD and application fee for retail zone bidding by
        M/S KGRL were funded through amounts transferred from M/S
        Indospirit Marketing Pvt. Ltd., whereafter the EMD and application
        fee were prepared from the account of the bidding entity. This
        allegation does not withstand scrutiny on a plain reading of the policy.
        There is no clause in the DEP-21/22 which mandates that the EMD
        must be sourced exclusively from the bidder’s own independent funds,
        nor is there any prohibition against financial assistance or fund
        transfers from another entity for the purpose of depositing EMD or
        application fee, provided the bidder satisfies the eligibility conditions
        and does not violate the expressly defined “related entity” restrictions.
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 292 of 549
        This position stands reflected in the contemporaneous departmental
        record, including the noting of the Accounts Branch {D-147 (94/N)},
        and is corroborated by the statement of PW-270, Shri Pankaj
        Bhatnagar, then Assistant Commissioner, who clarified that the policy
        did not impose any source-based restriction on the EMD.

   585.                     The central issue, therefore, is whether an act which is
        not prohibited by the policy, and which conforms to its express
        conditions, can nonetheless be treated as culpable merely by invoking
        the object of the policy. Such an approach is legally untenable. Penal
        consequences cannot be imposed on the basis of assumptions as to
        what the policy ought to have provided. Criminal liability must rest on
        the breach of a clearly defined prohibition, not on an inferred or
        postulated restriction.

   586.                     What the prosecution’s case effectively seeks to do is to
        read into the policy a condition which does not exist, and then to treat
        compliance with the actual text of the policy as suspicious. This
        exercise is impermissible. The regulatory framework derives its
        authority and certainty from its written terms. If the rule-making
        authority considered it necessary to restrict the source of EMD, it was
        open to it to do so by express provision. In the absence of such a
        stipulation, an entity acting within the framework of the policy cannot
        be faulted for taking advantage of what the policy itself permits.

                                                               (emphasis supplied)
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 293 of 549
   587.                     It is a settled principle that lawful conduct does not
        become criminal merely because it results in a commercial benefit or
        because, in hindsight, a different regulatory design might have been
        preferable. Acting within the four corners of the governing rules does
        not amount to an illegal act, nor does it satisfy the ingredients of
        conspiracy, which require an agreement to commit an offence or to
        achieve a lawful object by unlawful means.

   588.                     In these circumstances, the prosecution’s attempt to
        characterise the funding of the EMD and application fee through inter-
        entity transfers as evidence of indirect control, cartelisation, or
        conspiracy is devoid of legal foundation. In the absence of any
        violation of the express provisions of the DEP-21/22, the allegation
        rests on conjecture rather than law and is liable to be rejected at the
        threshold.

        (ii) Geetika Mahendru was the director of Geetech Dynamic Systems Pvt.
        Ltd. which was the holding company of M/S KGRL

   589.                     At the threshold, the prosecution seeks to draw an
        inference of control and cartelisation on the premise that the wife of
        A-7 was a director of M/S Geetech Dynamic Systems Pvt. Ltd. till
        30.03.2021 and that the said company subsequently became the
        holding company of M/S KGRL. This allegation, when tested against
        the statutory record and the statement of PW-27, does not withstand
        scrutiny.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 294 of 549
   590.                     The statement of PW-27, Sh. Arun Kumar Singh,
        Assistant Registrar of Companies, is of central relevance. From his
        deposition, the corporate existence and structure of M/S KGRL stand
        clearly established on the basis of ROC records. PW-27 states that “the
        company namely M/S Khao Gali Restaurants Pvt. Ltd. was
        incorporated on 08.08.1994” and was registered at “B-115, 2nd Floor,
        DDA Shed, Okhla Phase-I, New Delhi.” At incorporation, “500 shares
        were subscribed by Shri Shyam Kapur s/o Kundanlal Kapur, 500 by
        Geetam Kapur w/o Shri Shyam Kapur and 500 shares were with Tarun
        Kalra,” and “all these 03 shareholders were also the Directors of the
        company at the time of incorporation and continued as such till
        30.03.2021 when Ms. Geetam Kapur ceased to be the Director of the
        company.”

   591.                     PW-27 further explains the later shareholding position
        by recording that “as per annual return for the FY 2020-21, the total
        shares towards subscribed capital are 10,000,” out of which “99% of
        share holding (9,900 shares) of Khao Gali Restaurants Pvt. Ltd. is
        owned by M/S Geetech Dynamic Systems Pvt. Ltd., while remaining
        1% (100 shares) is being held by Shri Shyam Kundan Lal Kapur.” He
        clarifies that this restructuring occurred because “during the year
        2020-21, 4,500 shares held by Ms. Geetam Kapur, 4,400 shares held
        by Shri Shyam Kundan Lal Kapur and 1,000 shares held by Shri Tarun
        Kalra were transferred to M/S Geetech Dynamic Systems Pvt. Ltd.”

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 295 of 549
   592.                     The financial position of M/S KGRL is also placed on
        record by PW-27. He states that “as per Financial Statement for the
        FY-2020-2021, the company incurred a loss of Rs. 19,867/-,” and that
        only “Rs. 4,600/- was taken as loan from M/S Indospirit Distribution
        Ltd.” For the earlier year, he records that “Rs. 10,440/- & Rs. 2,400/-
        were taken as loan from M/S Indospirit Distribution Ltd. & M/S
        Indospirit Marketing Private Limited,” with similar losses and
        marginal borrowings reflected for FY-2019-20 and FY-2018-19. These
        figures, by their very magnitude, demonstrate that the company was a
        loss-making entity and that the borrowings were nominal and
        insignificant.

   593.                     PW-27 also establishes the corporate profile of M/S
        Geetech Dynamic Systems Pvt. Ltd., stating that it “was incorporated
        on 06.02.1998 at the address D-98, Anand Niketan, 3rd Floor,
        Delhi-110020.” At incorporation, “500 shares were subscribed by Shri
        Shyam Kapur s/o Kundanlal Kapur and 500 by Geetam Kapur w/o
        Shri Shyam Kapur,” and “both these shareholders were also the
        Directors of the company at the time of incorporation.” He traces the
        subsequent changes in directorship and records that “as per annual
        return for the FY 2020-21, the total shares towards subscribed capital
        are 10,000, out of which 90% of share holding (9,000 shares) of the
        company are held by Shri Shyam Kundan Lal Kapur while the
        remaining 1,000 shares are with Tushar Kapur,” further noting that

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 296 of 549
        “during the year 2020-21, 2,000 shares held by Ms. Geetam Kapur
        were transferred to Shri Shyam Kundan Lal Kapur.” PW-27 also notes
        that “Rs. 99,000/- was invested in M/S Khao Gali Restaurants Private
        Limited,” thereby explaining the shareholding link between the two
        companies.

   594.                     What clearly emerges from this material is that M/S
        KGRL became a subsidiary of M/S Geetech Dynamic Systems Pvt.
        Ltd. on the basis of share transfers duly reflected in ROC records.
        Equally significant is what does not emerge: PW-27 does not state
        anywhere that A-7 or his wife ever held any shareholding, directorship,
        or managerial position in M/S KGRL. The only reference to Indospirit
        entities is confined to nominal unsecured loans of Rs. 4,600/-, Rs.
        10,440/- and Rs. 2,400/-. Such trivial amounts, on their face, cannot
        establish ownership, control, dominance, or any group integration, and
        are wholly insufficient to support an allegation of cartelisation or
        conspiratorial control.

   595.                     In law, a director of a holding company who holds no
        shares therein, and who has no shareholding or directorial position in
        the subsidiary, cannot be attributed control over the subsidiary merely
        by virtue of such office. Control flows from legally enforceable rights
        in shareholding or from statutory or contractual powers recognised by
        law, not from a managerial designation in another juristic entity. The
        subsidiary remains a distinct corporate person; its voting rights,

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 297 of 549
        management and affairs vest exclusively in its shareholders and duly
        appointed directors. In the absence of any proprietary interest,
        contractual authority or statutory mandate linking A-7 or his wife to
        M/S KGRL, the prosecution’s attempt to infer control, ownership or
        cartelisation is founded on conjecture rather than evidence. At the
        stage of charge, such an allegation, unsupported by any legally
        cognisable indicia of control, stands dismantled at the threshold.

        (iii) Bubbly Beverages Pvt. Ltd. and the Allegation of Cross-Funding /
        Control by A-7 to M/S Magunta Agro Farms Pvt. Ltd.

   596.                     What emerges from the record is that M/S Bubbly
        Beverages Pvt. Ltd. transferred an amount of ₹25 crores to M/S
        Magunta Agro Farms Pvt. Ltd., which the prosecution seeks to
        characterise as “cross-funding” of EMD for obtaining an L-7Z licence.
        It is, however, an admitted position that approver Raghav Magunta
        Reddy (PW-225) was not a named partner in M/S Indospirit, the L-1
        wholesaler licence holder. The further attempt to attribute this
        transaction to A-7 on the premise that he was controlling M/S Bubbly
        Beverages Pvt. Ltd., and that such alleged control was exercised to
        influence or dominate retail zoning through EMD funding, finds no
        support from the record.

   597.                     From the statement of PW-27, Sh. Arun Kumar Singh,
        Assistant Registrar of Companies, and the statutory ROC records
        proved through him, the corporate position of both M/S Indospirit

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                    Page no. 298 of 549
        Retail Pvt. Ltd. and M/S Bubbly Beverages Pvt. Ltd. stands clearly
        established. PW-27 records that M/S Indospirit Retail Pvt. Ltd. was
        incorporated on 21.11.2012 with a subscribed capital of 10,000 equity
        shares, initially held by M/S Indospirit Distribution Ltd. through
        Sameer Mahandru (9,000 shares) and Sudershan Lal Mahandru (1,000
        shares), both of whom were directors. PW-27 further records that by
        31.03.2021, the entire shareholding stood transferred to Nitin Kapoor
        (9,000 shares) and Soni Singh (1,000 shares), and that Sameer
        Mahandru resigned from the directorship on 30.03.2021 and
        Sudershan Lal Mahandru on 10.07.2021. Thus, with effect from
        31.03.2021, M/S Indospirit Retail Pvt. Ltd. stood wholly owned and
        controlled by Nitin Kapoor and Soni Singh, with no subsisting
        shareholding or managerial role of A-7.

   598.                     As regards M/S Bubbly Beverages Pvt. Ltd., PW-27’s
        statement and the ROC filings show that Ms. Geetika Mahandru never
        held any position of director, shareholder, or manager at any stage.
        PW-27 attributes to her no shareholding or managerial role
        whatsoever. The involvement of A-7 in Bubbly Beverages was
        confined to a minority shareholding of 10% up to 31.03.2020. PW-27
        further records that in March 2021, the shares held by A-7 were
        entirely transferred, resulting in him holding zero shares with effect
        from 31.03.2021. Thereafter, 99% of the shareholding of Bubbly
        Beverages stood with M/S Indospirit Retail Pvt. Ltd. and 1% with

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                    Page no. 299 of 549
        Nitin Kapoor, followed by the resignation of A-7 from the directorship
        on 20.07.2021. The board thereafter comprised Nitin Kapoor and Soni
        Singh. Thus, during and after the relevant period, neither A-7 nor his
        wife exercised any ownership or managerial control over Bubbly
        Beverages.

   599.                     In this background, the prosecution’s theory that A-7
        controlled M/S Bubbly Beverages Pvt. Ltd. and, through it, sought to
        control retail zoning by alleged EMD cross-funding is not borne out
        from the statutory record. Even otherwise, as already discussed, the
        Excise Policy does not prohibit funding of EMD by one entity for
        another. Mere funding or financial assistance, in the absence of any
        change in shareholding or directorship, does not result in transfer of
        control. Inter-corporate loans and monetary assistance are well-
        recognised commercial arrangements in corporate law and, by
        themselves, cannot be treated as devices to create cartelisation or
        confer control.

                                                             (emphasis supplied)

   600.                     On a cumulative assessment, the record does not
        disclose any material to show that the ₹25-crore transaction resulted
        in, or was intended to result in, ownership, control, or dominance of
        retail zones by A-7. The allegation rests on assumption rather than
        admissible material and stands contradicted by the ROC material and
        the statement of PW-27.

        (iv) Allegation of Cross-Funding of EMD by Zenab Pvt. Ltd. (Magunta
        Group) to M/S KGRL

   601.                     The prosecution has alleged that a sum of ₹25 crores
        was transferred by M/S Zenab Pvt. Ltd., a company stated to be
        associated with the Magunta group, to M/S KGRL, and that such
        transfer constituted “cross-funding” intended to create cartelisation in
        the excise retail tender process. On a careful scrutiny of the material
        placed on record, this allegation does not withstand examination.

   602.                     The prosecution itself relies heavily upon the statement
        of the approver, Raghav Magunta Reddy (PW-226). A significant
        aspect of his deposition, however, runs contrary to the prosecution
        narrative. PW-226 categorically states that the amount of ₹25 crores
        transferred to M/S KGRL was subsequently returned. This admission
        is of decisive relevance. The return of the entire amount clearly
        establishes that the transaction was not in the nature of an investment,
        capital contribution, or consideration for any assured benefit, but was,
        at best, a temporary financial accommodation or friendly loan.

   603.                     The very fact of repayment negates the essential premise
        of cartelisation. Cartelisation, by its very nature, presupposes a
        continuing alignment of commercial interests, mutual assurance of
        benefit, or a sustained financial stake in the business operations of
        another entity. A transaction which is fully reversed, without any
        evidence of retained benefit, ownership interest, or managerial

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 301 of 549
        influence, cannot be characterised as a cartel-forming device. There is
        no material to suggest that the transfer of funds resulted in any change
        in shareholding, directorship, or control of M/S KGRL, nor is there
        any evidence that Zenab Pvt. Ltd. acquired any proprietary or
        beneficial interest in the said company.

   604.                     Further, there is no provision in the Excise Policy which
        prohibits an entity from receiving financial assistance or loans for
        arranging the EMD, so long as the eligibility conditions prescribed
        under the policy are otherwise fulfilled. Mere funding of EMD, in the
        absence of any statutory bar, does not ipso facto amount to
        cartelisation. To elevate such a transaction to a criminal conspiracy,
        there must be material showing that the funding translated into control,
        dominance, or coordinated conduct in restraint of competition. No
        such material is forthcoming on the record.

   605.                     In the present case, the prosecution’s own approver
        demolishes the allegation by admitting that the ₹25-crore amount was
        returned. This admission is wholly inconsistent with the theory of
        cartelisation or cross-holding of interests. A repaid loan or friendly
        financial assistance, without anything more, cannot be treated as
        evidence of a collusive arrangement or an attempt to manipulate the
        tender process, which even otherwise has not been disputed.

   606.                     Accordingly, on the basis of the statement of approver
        PW-226 read in the absence of any corroborative material indicating
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 302 of 549
        continuing benefit, control, or concerted action, this Court finds that
        the allegation of cross-funding of EMD by Zenab Pvt. Ltd. to M/S
        KGRL as a device for cartelisation is unsupported by the evidence and
        rests on conjecture rather than legally sustainable material.

        (v) Legal Position

   607.                     The DEP-21/22 contains in-built safeguards to prevent
        vertical integration, cartelisation and conflict of interest. A central
        safeguard is the definition of “related entities” / “sister concerns”,
        which is consciously structured around ownership, control and
        management, and not the mere source of funds. Under the policy,
        entities are treated as related only where there exists common
        proprietorship, partnership or directorship, or where majority
        ownership (51% or more) vests in the same person or group of persons
        across such entities.

   608.                     The touchstone is effective control and beneficial
        ownership. In this statutory framework, mere funding of EMD for
        bidding in retail zones by a wholesaler or manufacturer does not, by
        itself, constitute a violation of the policy. Funding, simpliciter, does
        not ipso facto result in acquisition of ownership or transfer of control.
        The statutory disability is attracted only where such funding
        culminates in the wholesaler or manufacturer acquiring 51% or more
        ownership or decisive managerial control in the retail entity.
        Conversely, where financial assistance, whether by way of loan,
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 303 of 549
        advance, guarantee or facilitation of EMD, is extended without any
        corresponding shift in shareholding, partnership rights or directorial
        control, the essential ingredients of disqualification remain absent. The
        policy does not prohibit commercial funding arrangements per se; it
        proscribes concentration of ownership and control beyond the
        prescribed threshold.

   609.                     Applying this settled legal position, the allegation sought
        to be raised in relation to M/S KGRL does not give rise to any statutory
        disqualification vis-à-vis M/S Indospirit. Quite apart from the legal
        principle that funding alone is insufficient, the factual foundation itself
        is missing. There is no material establishing that the EMD or bid
        amount of M/S KGRL was funded by M/S Indospirit, nor any evidence
        of common ownership, management or majority control between the
        two. Across all three entities, the evidence of PW-27 remains confined
        to statutory ROC filings; PW-28 speaks only to internal corporate
        compliance and risk-assessment processes of a private manufacturer;
        and PW-34’s banking evidence does not establish ownership, control
        or policy-field activity. In the absence of any legally cognisable indicia
        of ownership or control, and in the face of independent due-diligence
        findings categorising the entities as Low Risk, the prosecution’s
        attempt to subsume M/S KGRL, M/S Bubbly Beverages Pvt. Ltd. and
        M/S Indospirit Retail Pvt. Ltd. within an alleged “Indospirit
        network” is unsupported by the record.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 304 of 549
   610.                     In sum, the DEP-21/22 draws a clear and deliberate
        distinction between prohibited ownership/control structures and
        permissible commercial financing arrangements. Unless funding
        results in acquisition of majority ownership or effective control, it
        neither violates the policy nor disentitles a wholesaler from
        consideration for, or grant of, an L-1 licence. The material on record,
        taken at its highest, fails to disclose any such prohibited nexus or
        cartelisation.

        (II) Alleged Generation and Transfer of Proceeds of Crime by Active
        Participation of A-7 through Transfer of 61% of Profits of M/S
        Indospirits to A-5

   611.                     At this stage, the Court finds it necessary to distinctly
        separate the allegation as projected by the prosecution from the
        governing legal principles applicable to partnerships and joint
        ventures, and to test the allegation against the contemporaneous
        documentary record placed on file. The prosecution proceeds on the
        premise that M/S Indospirits functioned as a joint venture in which
        M/S Indospirit Distribution Pvt. Ltd. held 35%, Prem Rahul Manduri
        (PW-270) held 32.5%, and A.R. Pillai (A-5) held 32.25%, and that
        approximately 61% of the profits were ultimately transferred to A-5.
        This circumstance is sought to be portrayed as suspicious and
        indicative of the generation of “proceeds of crime”.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 305 of 549
   612.                     At the very threshold, however, this premise stands
        contradicted by contemporaneous documentary material, namely
        Document D-9, being the letter dated 07.11.2022, which is brought on
        record by PW-26. Document D-9 records, in clear and unequivocal
        terms, that from the inception of the partnership there existed a mutual
        understanding and arrangement among the three partners, Indospirit
        Distribution Pvt. Ltd., Prem Rahul Manduri (PW-270) and A-5, that
        PW-270, who was the associate/friend/partner of A-5; that the act and
        management of the affairs of the firm on behalf of Prem Rahul
        Manduri will be done by A-5; and that it was verbally agreed between
        the partners that the share of profit of the firm attributable to both A-5
        and PW-270 would be disbursed either to A-5 or as per his instructions.
        The document further records that Prem Rahul Manduri had no
        objection whatsoever to this arrangement and that, in pursuance
        thereof, a total amount of Rs. 29,29,99,124/-, representing the
        combined profit share of A-5 and PW-270, was transferred by the firm
        either to A-5 or as per his directions. This position has been affirmed
        in the statement of PW-26, dated 08.11.2022, which is relied by the
        Investigating Agency.

   613.                     It is expressly clarified by PW-26 that, owing to this
        prior mutual understanding and express consent of PW-270, no
        amount was paid directly to him towards his share of profits. Of
        considerable significance is the fact that there is nothing on record to

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 306 of 549
        show that this arrangement was ever objected to, disputed, or
        considered unacceptable by any of the partners, and in particular by
        Prem Rahul Manduri (PW-270), whose profit share is alleged to have
        been routed in the aforesaid manner. There is no complaint, protest,
        civil claim, correspondence, or contemporaneous material suggesting
        dissent, coercion, or absence of consent on his part. On the contrary,
        the documentary record affirmatively reflects acceptance and
        acquiescence, consistent with the mutual understanding recorded in
        D-9. Once this contemporaneous explanation, emanating from the
        firm itself and furnished to the investigating agency, is taken into
        account, the prosecution’s attempt to portray the flow of profits as
        suspicious appears wholly artificial. The document does not disclose
        any        clandestine      diversion,    concealment,    or    unauthorised
        appropriation; rather, it evidences a consensual inter-se arrangement
        between partners, operating from the inception of the partnership, with
        full knowledge and consent of the concerned partner.

   614.                     Even at this stage, the prosecution does not point to any
        statutory prohibition, any contractual bar in the Joint Venture
        Agreement or partnership arrangement, or any provision of the Excise
        Policy which restricts or regulates the manner in which profits or inter-
        se partner adjustments may be structured or routed. The mere fact that
        profits may ultimately accrue disproportionately to one participant
        does not, by itself, attract criminality. There exists no principle in law

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 307 of 549
        which mandates that profit distribution must invariably mirror
        shareholding percentages, nor is any deviation from pro-rata
        distribution ipso facto illegal. Commercial practice recognises that
        profits or economic benefits may legitimately flow unevenly on
        account of operational control, managerial responsibility, prior
        understanding, or inter-se adjustments agreed between partners.
        Document D-9 squarely places the present case within this legitimate
        commercial domain by recording that the routing of profits was the
        result of a prior mutual understanding and express consent, and not a
        unilateral act or covert diversion.

   615.                     Even when examined through the lens of partnership
        law, the legal position remains well settled. A conjoint reading of the
        provisions of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 places contractual
        autonomy at the centre of the partnership framework. Section 4 defines
        partnership as a relationship founded on agreement to share profits.
        Section 13(b) expressly provides that partners are entitled to share
        profits equally unless otherwise agreed, thereby recognising unequal
        or disproportionate profit sharing pursuant to contract. Sections 13(a),
        13(c) and 13(d) further recognise legitimate inter-se financial
        adjustments, including remuneration, interest, indemnification and
        reimbursement, which may naturally result in one partner receiving
        substantially higher monetary inflows than another. The Act prescribes
        no ceiling or proportional limit on profit allocation and does not

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                    Page no. 308 of 549
        prohibit a dominant or majority flow of profits to one partner pursuant
        to consented arrangements.

   616.                     At this juncture, the prosecution has attempted to
        superimpose an additional narrative by portraying PW-270 (Prem
        Rahul Manduri) as a mere conduit or proxy acting on behalf of
        approver Raghav Magunta Reddy (PW-226). This theory, however,
        does not find support either from the contemporaneous documentary
        record or from the logical chain of circumstances emerging on record.
        If PW-270 were indeed acting only as a front or benami for another,
        there exists no rational explanation as to why he would expressly
        consent to his contractual share of profits being routed to the account
        of A-5 (Arun Ramachandran Pillai), rather than to any entity or
        account connected with the alleged principal. Such conduct is wholly
        inconsistent with the prosecution’s own theory of proxy ownership or
        concealed beneficial interest. It is in this context that the prosecution
        has sought to rely upon the statement of PW-270 to dilute the
        evidentiary impact of the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA), dated
        29.10.2021 which is D-72 (5660-5666) itself. However, this attempt is
        legally untenable. PW-270 has unequivocally admitted his signature
        on the JVA and has stated that he “received the aforesaid documents
        through post and after signing sent them back”. Once such admission
        stands on record, the execution of the document stands proved within
        the meaning of Section 67 of the Indian Evidence Act. Upon proof of

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                     Page no. 309 of 549
        execution, the contents of the written instrument attract the statutory
        bar contained in Sections 91 and 92 of the Evidence Act, which
        prohibit oral contradiction, variation or disclaimer of the terms of a
        written contract. The law raises a settled presumption that a person
        who appends his signature to a written instrument does so with
        knowledge of its contents and with the intention of being bound
        thereby. A bare assertion that the witness was unaware of the contents,
        without any legally recognised vitiating plea, is inconsequential and
        cannot dilute the evidentiary sanctity of the document.

                                                            (emphasis supplied)

   617.                     Significantly, PW-270 has not alleged, either in his
        statement or otherwise, that the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) was
        executed under fraud, misrepresentation, coercion, undue influence, or
        any other circumstance recognised in law as vitiating consent. He has
        not claimed that the document was blank or incomplete at the time of
        signing, nor has he alleged deception as to the nature of the instrument.
        In the absence of such foundational pleas, the belated attempt to
        disclaim the contents of the JVA amounts to nothing more than an
        impermissible oral contradiction of a written contract, expressly
        barred under Section 92 of the Evidence Act. The Court is, therefore,
        constrained to hold that the statement of PW-270, insofar as it seeks to
        dispute or deny the contents of the JVA after admitting his signature
        thereon, is legally inadmissible and does not create even a prima facie

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 310 of 549
        dent in the evidentiary value of the JVA. The Court proceeds on the
        settled presumption that the Joint Venture Agreement was validly
        executed with full knowledge of its contents by all signatories. The
        subsequent conduct relied upon by the prosecution namely, the
        application moved by PW-270 for exiting the Joint Venture
        Agreement, also does not advance the conspiracy narrative as he
        himself in his statement dated 12.10.2022 has stated that he was forced
        to exist the firm as he was not able to give bank guarantee. Withdrawal
        from, or restructuring of, a commercial arrangement at a later stage is
        a business decision and, in the absence of any contemporaneous
        incriminating circumstance, cannot retrospectively convert an
        otherwise lawful profit-sharing arrangement into a criminal
        conspiracy. No material is shown to suggest that the exit from the JVA
        was triggered by exposure of illegality, receipt of illicit funds, or any
        enforcement action, nor is it shown to be temporally or causally linked
        to any alleged offence. Commercial disengagement, without more,
        remains legally neutral.

   618.                     Crucially, for the prosecution’s theory to even prima
        facie qualify as involving “proceeds of crime”, it must establish a clear
        causal nexus showing that the profits were generated as a consequence
        of an illegal act and that their transfer was in pursuance of such
        illegality. In the present case, no illegal clause in the JVA is identified,
        no violation of the Excise Policy is demonstrated, and no evidentiary

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 311 of 549
        linkage is shown between the profit routing and any act of corruption,
        abuse of office, or policy manipulation. On the contrary, Document
        D-9 affirmatively demonstrates a lawful, consensual, and pre-existing
        commercial               arrangement   governing   the   manner      of      profit
        disbursement.

   619.                     Viewed thus, the prosecution’s attempt to characterise
        the alleged transfer of approximately 61% of profits as inherently
        suspicious stands dismantled both factually and legally. Absent proof
        of a prohibitory contractual clause, a statutory violation, or an illegal
        source of income, and in the face of contemporaneous documents
        evidencing mutual understanding, consent, and absence of objection,
        the allegation rests on assumption rather than law and does not
        disclose even a prima facie case.

        (III) Outcome of Evaluation

        Conspiracy-Absence of Participation, Contingency-Based Theory, and
        Conduct Inconsistent with Alleged Design

   620.                     At the outset, it bears emphasis that A-7 was concededly
        not a member of the so-called “South Group” that is alleged to have
        travelled to Delhi and stayed at Hotel Oberoi between 14th and 17th
        March 2021. It is equally undisputed that A-7 was not a participant in
        the meetings purportedly held during 21.05.2021 at Gauri Apartment,
        nor was he present at the meeting allegedly convened at ITC Kohinoor,


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                            Page no. 312 of 549
        Hyderabad, on 19.06.2021, which, according to the prosecution, is
        where the conspiracy is said to have crystallised and where an alleged
        decision was taken to pay an upfront amount of ₹20-30 crores to A-3
        for “tweaking” the policy.

   621.                     On the prosecution’s own showing, therefore, A-7 stood
        entirely outside the meetings that are projected as the formative and
        decisive moments of the alleged conspiracy. The edifice of conspiracy
        sought to be erected against A-7 is thus not founded on participation,
        presence, or contemporaneous conduct, but rests on a narrative
        constructed in hindsight.

   622.                     More fundamentally, the conspiracy theory propounded
        by the prosecution is inherently contingent and speculative. It
        proceeds on the presupposition that M/S Indospirits would first secure
        an L-1 licence, and thereafter be appointed as a distributor by M/S
        PRI. This two-stage sequence was not within the control of any of the
        alleged conspirators. The grant of an L-1 licence is a statutory and
        regulatory process, and the subsequent appointment of a distributor is
        a commercial decision of the manufacturer. Significantly, neither M/S
        PRI nor M/S Diageo is alleged to be a participant in the conspiracy.
        These were not ancillary or peripheral contingencies; they were the
        very foundations on which the prosecution’s theory of “recoupment”
        of alleged upfront payments rests. Absent these events, the alleged



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 313 of 549
        conspiracy would be commercially irrational and incapable of
        fruition.

                                                              (emphasis supplied)

   623.                     The actual course of events during the implementation
        of the policy does not support the prosecution’s case of a pre-planned
        and effectively executed conspiracy. M/S KGRL failed to secure an
        L-7Z licence even in the first round. M/S Indospirits (IMPL) was
        required to withdraw its initial application for grant of an L-1 licence
        after issuance of three show-cause notices, the last of which was issued
        in the final week of October. This is so despite the allegation that A-7
        had already paid ₹30 lakhs to A-2. If an arrangement of the nature
        alleged, operating at the highest levels, had in fact existed, such
        repeated regulatory impediments would not have arisen.

   624.                     The inconsistency becomes more pronounced when it is
        noted that, notwithstanding the allegation of receipt of substantial
        “upfront” amounts, the persons said to be party to the conspiracy were
        unable to secure even routine regulatory approvals. The assertion that
        the Dy. CM (A-8) and CM (A-18) were in a position to ensure
        favourable outcomes stands at variance with the record, which shows
        that M/S Indospirits encountered repeated regulatory obstacles and did
        not obtain the L-1 licence with ease, if at all.

   625.                     The record also reflects that M/S Indospirit Marketing
        Pvt. Ltd. (IMPL – JV), by application dated 09.09.2021, initially
        applied for grant of an L-1 licence showing only two partners, M/S
        IMPL and M/S Indospirit Distribution Pvt. Ltd. (IDPL). No entity
        alleged to form part of the “South Group” was shown as a partner at
        that stage. If, as suggested, it had already been decided that
        recoupment would be effected through this entity, there was no reason
        for excluding the supposed beneficiaries from the partnership at
        inception. The structure of the application does not indicate a settled
        or pre-existing design.

                                                              (emphasis supplied)

   626.                     It is a matter of record that at a later stage accused
        persons associated with the South Group were inducted. Even
        thereafter, the application did not receive any preferential treatment.
        Three deficiency memos were issued, and ultimately the application
        was withdrawn as the entity failed to meet the prescribed turnover
        eligibility of ₹150 crores. The sequence indicates scrutiny and non-
        compliance rather than facilitation.

   627.                     The contradiction becomes sharper when examined in
        the context of the allegation concerning the second draft GoM report.
        The prosecution asserts that the draft was prepared from pages
        supplied by members of the South Group and that the turnover
        criterion was enhanced to ₹500 crores per year for the preceding five
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 315 of 549
        years. Had such a stipulation been retained, entities such as M/S
        Indospirit would have been rendered ineligible altogether. The very
        condition said to have been introduced at their instance would have
        defeated the alleged object of recoupment.

   628.                     On a cumulative reading, these circumstances do not
        disclose acts in furtherance of a conspiracy. Acceptance of the
        prosecution case as it stands would lead to the conclusion that the
        alleged beneficiaries introduced eligibility conditions that disqualified
        themselves. Such a position does not accord with ordinary
        probabilities and exposes a fundamental inconsistency in the theory
        advanced.

                                                              (emphasis supplied)

   629.                     Further, M/S KGRL was subjected to proceedings by the
        Income Tax Department, initiated at the instance of the very Excise
        Department that is alleged to have favoured the group. Even the
        approver, Raghav Magunta Reddy (PW-226)-who claims to have paid
        ₹10 crores in March and ₹15 crores in June-could not secure a No
        Objection Certificate for operating the Airport Zone. These facts are
        wholly inconsistent with the prosecution’s thesis of undue favour,
        assured outcomes, or policy-level manipulation.

                                                             (emphasis supplied)

   630.                     In sum, the contemporaneous conduct and objective
        outcomes during the execution of the policy demonstrate persistent
        regulatory resistance rather than preferential treatment. The
        difficulties faced by the so-called “South Group” and by A-7 at every
        material stage decisively negate any inference of undue favour or pre-
        arranged benefit. Far from supporting a conspiracy of the magnitude
        alleged, the record reveals a sequence of events that is antithetical to
        the very notion of a successful, centrally controlled conspiratorial
        design.

        Allegation against A-6

   631.                     A-6 Mootha Gautham is alleged to have provided the
        corporate infrastructure and financial channels necessary for layering
        and integration of proceeds derived from the manipulated wholesale
        arrangement. It is stated that entities effectively under his control,
        including IANPL, APPL, CDG Broadcasting Pvt. Ltd., and Zeus
        Networking Pvt. Ltd., received substantial amounts either directly
        from M/S Indospirits or indirectly through accused Arun Pillai (A-5),
        without any legitimate commercial basis. Transfers described as
        payments for a “programme” or as “loans” are alleged to be
        unsupported by agreements, broadcast records or genuine loan
        documentation, with key witnesses asserting they were made to sign
        as attesting witnesses without understanding the contents. The
        prosecution contends that A-6 knowingly facilitated the masking of

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                    Page no. 317 of 549
        tainted funds as business receipts or repayments in furtherance of the
        conspiracy.

        Allegations against A-4

   632.                     The prosecution describes A-4, Abhishek Boinpally, as a
        key member of the “South Group” and attributes to him a participative
        role in the alleged conspiracy. It is alleged that he was in Delhi
        between 14.03.2021 and 17.03.2021. During this period, Vijay Nair is
        stated to have met the South Group on 14.03.2021, and it is alleged
        that a 36-page printout was handed over to him, which is said to be the
        second draft GoM report dated 19.03.2021, later finalized on
        22.03.2021.

   633.                     It is further alleged that A-4 attended the meeting
        arranged at Gauri Apartment on 21.05.2021 and was also present at
        the meeting held at ITC Kohinoor on 19.06.2021. These meetings are
        relied upon by the prosecution as forming part of the sequence of
        events connected with the alleged conspiracy.

   634.                     The prosecution also alleges that A-4 acted as a mediator
        in relation to the payment of ₹15 crores to A-17 K. Kavitha by Raghav
        Magunta. According to the prosecution, the said amount was delivered
        to A-21 Vinod Chauhan through Ashok Kaushik, Personal Assistant to
        A-17 K. Kavitha, and was thereafter routed towards Goa. It is further
        alleged that on 20.09.2021, A-4 was present at a meeting where A-7


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 318 of 549
        Sameer Mahendru introduced him and A-5 Arun R. Pillai as potential
        investors in M/S Indospirits.

   635.                     On the financial aspect, it is alleged that A-4 invested
        ₹1.29 crores in M/S India Ahead News by purchasing its logo. The
        prosecution further states that ₹3.85 crores were received from A-6
        Mootha Gautam, stated to have emanated from M/S Indospirits, out of
        which ₹3.70 crores were transferred to CDG Broadcasting, described
        as being owned by A-4 Abhishek Boinpally and A-6 Mootha Gautam,
        and ₹85.5 lakhs were transferred to Pankaj Arora of CDG.

        Allegation against A-5

   636.                     The prosecution portrays A-5, Arun Ramchandra Pillai,
        as a member of the alleged “South Group” and attributes to him
        participation in certain meetings said to form part of the broader
        conspiracy. It is alleged that he was present in Delhi between
        14.03.2021 and 17.03.2021, during which period Vijay Nair (A-3) met
        the South Group on 14.03.2021 and was handed over a 36-page
        printout stated to be the second draft GoM report dated 19.03.2021
        later finalized on 22.03.2021. He is further alleged to have attended
        the meeting at Gauri Apartment on 21.05.2021 and the meeting at ITC
        Kohinoor on 19.06.2021.

   637.                     It is also alleged that he invested in M/S Indospirits with
        32.5% shareholding, the investment being stated to have been


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 319 of 549
        arranged by A-17 K. Kavitha. While the shareholding is described as
        32.5%, the actual amount invested is stated to be ₹3.40 crores. The
        prosecution further alleges that approximately 61% of the profits of
        M/S Indospirits, quantified at about ₹29.29 crores, were received by
        him or distributed at his instance as part of a recoupment plan, a
        portion of which was shared with A-4 Abhishek Boinpally.

        Consolidated Consideration of Allegations against A-4, A-5 and A-6
        under the “Media-Transaction Theory”

   638.                     The allegations pertaining to A-4, A-5 and A-6 are being
        examined conjointly at this stage for reasons of convenience and
        continuity. The prosecution has projected a composite narrative
        linking these three accused in relation to transactions involving APPL
        and IANPL It is alleged that certain monetary credits were made by
        A-4 and A-5 to the aforesaid entities and that the acquisition of the
        logo/trademark of the “India Ahead” news channel formed part of the
        broader design attributed to them. This cluster of allegations has been
        described by the prosecution as forming part of what may conveniently
        be referred to as the “Media Transaction Theory”.

   639.                     While the principal financial dealings are stated to have
        taken place between A-4 and A-6, the prosecution seeks to weave A-5
        into the same framework on the premise of an overarching conspiracy.
        It is alleged that substantial sums, far in excess of declared
        investments, were received from M/S Indospirits’ profits and
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 320 of 549
        thereafter routed onwards to entities associated with A-6 and
        ultimately to entities controlled by A-4 under the guise of loans or
        commercial transactions.

   640.                     A-6 is alleged to have provided the corporate
        infrastructure and financial channels for layering and integration of the
        alleged proceeds of crime, with entities under his control, including
        media and networking companies, receiving funds described as
        programme                payments   or   loans,   allegedly   unsupported         by
        contemporaneous agreements, broadcast records or genuine loan
        documentation. According to the prosecution, these interlinked
        financial movements constituted the mechanism by which the alleged
        advance funding was repaid and profits were distributed among the
        conspirators, thereby rendering the participation of all three accused
        integral to both the financing and profiteering facets of the alleged
        conspiracy.

   641.                     In addition, the meetings stated to have taken place at
        Gauri Apartment, Delhi, and at ITC Kohinoor, Hyderabad, are also
        relied upon by the prosecution as part of the same sequence of events.
        Since these allegations are projected against A-4 and A-5 in a
        connected manner, they are being considered together for the purpose
        of appreciating the prosecution narrative in its entirety.




CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                            Page no. 321 of 549
   642.           After addressing the common allegations and overlapping
        circumstances, the contentions specific to A-4 and A-5 shall be
        examined separately on their individual merits.

        Media–Transaction Theory:
        (A) Loan Agreement dated 18.02.2022
   643.                     The prosecution has sought to cast a cloud over the
        transaction involving the transfer of ₹3.85 crores between A-5, A-6
        and A-4 by assailing the authenticity of the Loan Agreement dated
        18.02.2022, which is D-29. The objection rests solely on two planks:
        first, that the witnesses to the document signed it at the instance of A-6
        without being aware of its contents; and second, that the document is
        neither registered nor notarised. In support, reliance has been placed
        on the statements of PW-14 Pottipochayalu Madhan and PW-29 Asif
        Baba. Upon a close and careful scrutiny of the record, this line of
        reasoning is found to proceed on a clear misapprehension of law and,
        more importantly, to stand contradicted by the prosecution’s own
        evidence.

   644.                     Both PW-14 and PW-29 have unequivocally stated that
        they appended their signatures on the Loan Agreement dated
        18.02.2022 and on the Asset Purchase and Trademark Assignment
        Deed dated 10.06.2022 in the capacity of witnesses and on the
        instructions of the Managing Director, Mootha Gowtham. They have
        further identified the signatures of A-6 and A-4 on the said documents

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 322 of 549
        on the basis of familiarity acquired during the course of their
        employment. Significantly, neither witness has disputed his own
        signatures nor questioned the signatures of the accused on the Loan
        Agreement. They also did not have made any suggestion, let alone an
        allegation, that the document was fabricated, forged, ante-dated, or
        executed without the consent of the parties concerned.

   645.                     The limited evidentiary role of an attesting witness is too
        well settled to admit of debate. Such a witness is required only to speak
        to the factum of execution of the document. He is neither expected nor
        required in law to have knowledge of, or to depose about, the contents
        of the document or the commercial rationale underlying the
        transaction. The prosecution’s attempt to impeach the agreement on
        the ground that the witnesses were unaware of its contents betrays a
        fundamental              misunderstanding   of   the   principles       governing
        admissibility of private documents.
                                                                 (emphasis supplied)
   646.                     The fallacy in the prosecution’s approach becomes even
        more apparent when tested against the scheme of the Indian Contract
        Act, 1872, which recognises the validity and enforceability of oral
        contracts. The law does not mandate attestation as a condition
        precedent to the validity of a contract. Even in the absence of any
        witness, a contract does not become void or suspect merely for want
        of attestation. To therefore discredit a written loan agreement on the

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                              Page no. 323 of 549
        ground that the attesting witnesses did not know its contents is to
        import a requirement which the law itself does not recognise.
                                                                (emphasis supplied)

   647.                     If such a line of reasoning were to be accepted, it would
        enable the investigating agency to brand any private commercial
        document as sham on the basis of conjecture, without disclosing a
        single legally cognisable infirmity in its execution. This would amount
        to permitting narrative to displace evidence, an approach wholly alien
        to criminal jurisprudence.

   648.                     The prosecution’s further objection based on the absence
        of registration or notarisation is equally untenable. There exists no
        statutory mandate requiring compulsory registration or notarisation of
        a private loan agreement of this nature. The Registration Act, 1908
        restricts        compulsory     registration   to   documents     specifically
        enumerated therein, and a simple loan agreement does not fall within
        that category. The absence of registration or notarisation, by itself,
        carries no adverse legal consequence and cannot be treated as a
        circumstance undermining the genuineness of the document.

   649.                     Viewed in its entirety, the reliance placed on the
        statements of PW-14 and PW-29 does not advance the prosecution
        case in the slightest. On the contrary, their evidence affirmatively
        establishes execution of the Loan Agreement dated 18.02.2022 and
        dispels any suggestion of fabrication or impropriety. The challenge
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 324 of 549
        mounted by the investigating agency is thus founded on a legally
        unsound premise and an evidentially hollow hypothesis, and cannot be
        permitted to sustain even a prima facie doubt as to the genuineness of
        the transaction.

        (B) Pre-Existing Financial Dealings as Admitted by PW-29

   650.                     The prosecution’s narrative further suffers a serious
        setback from the statement of PW-29, who admits that an aggregate
        amount of Rs. 6.53 crores was received in the personal account of A-6
        through nine transactions commencing from 10.11.2020. These
        transactions originate from a period anterior to the timeframe during
        which the prosecution alleges that the accused entered into any
        conspiracy relating to the Excise Policy. Once the prosecution’s own
        witness acknowledges substantial financial dealings prior to the
        alleged conspiracy, the theory that subsequent transactions necessarily
        represent circulation of “proceeds of crime” becomes untenable. The
        record instead discloses an ongoing business relationship which has
        retrospectively been sought to be given a criminal colour.

   651.                     The position is further fortified by another material
        portion of PW-29’s statement, wherein he states: “On being asked I
        state that I know Mr. Abhishek Boinpally, because my MD Mr.
        Mootha Goutham introduced me probably in October 2020 with him
        as a potential investor in India Ahead News Pvt. Ltd. and Shri
        Boinpally Abhishek wanted to see the financial statement of company
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 325 of 549
        Andhra Prabha Publication Ltd. and India Ahead New Pvt. Ltd. for
        which Mr. Boinpally was handed over some financial documents of
        both the company.”

   652.                     The extract is significant. It establishes that as early as
        October 2020, A-4 had been introduced as a prospective investor in
        IANPL, and had sought access to the financial statements of APPL and
        IANPL Such a request is consistent with customary commercial due
        diligence undertaken by an investor prior to entering the media
        business.

   653.                     The chronology is decisive. October 2020 not only
        precedes the period during which the alleged conspiracy is said to have
        taken shape, but also aligns with the commencement of the financial
        transactions spoken of by PW-29. Both the financial dealings and the
        preliminary steps in the media domain thus trace back to a time
        anterior to the projected conspiracy period. The subsequent purchase
        of the logo and the acquisition of CDG Broadcasting Pvt. Ltd. and
        Zeus Networking Pvt. Ltd. appear to be a natural progression of an
        intention that had already crystallised in October 2020. The sequence,
        from examination of financial records to structured corporate
        acquisitions, bears the hallmarks of a continuing commercial
        engagement in the media sector. When viewed in this light, the attempt
        to attribute a criminal complexion to transactions demonstrably rooted
        in pre-existing business dealings does not sustain scrutiny.

        (C) Acquisition of CDG Broadcasting Pvt. Ltd. and Zeus Networking
        Pvt. Ltd.

   654.                     Upon a careful and conjoint reading of the statements of
        PW-15 Smt. Lalita Dutt and PW-16 Sh. Pankaj Arora, this Court finds
        that the acquisition of shares of M/S Zeus Networking Pvt. Ltd. stands
        explained through contemporaneous corporate records and formal
        documentary instruments, which significantly pre-date the period
        during which the prosecution alleges the hatching of conspiracy.

   655.                     PW-15, who was associated with the accounts and
        financial records of CDG Broadcast Pvt. Ltd., first delineates the
        shareholding structure of Zeus Networking Pvt. Ltd. and identifies the
        issuance of share certificates. She categorically states: “...On being
        asked I state that following are the shareholding pattern of this
        company:..”.

   656.                     She thereafter records that CDG Broadcast Pvt. Ltd. held
        30,00,000 shares, Sh. Pankaj Arora held 45,000 shares, and Smt.
        Arpita Arora held 5,000 shares, making a total of 30,50,000 shares.
        PW-15 further identifies the contemporaneous share certificates by
        stating: “...On being asked about the documents available at page 53-
        60, I state that vide these documents Director of Zeus Networking Pvt.
        Ltd. issue share certificate of shareholder of Zeus Networking Pvt.
        Ltd. i.e. CDG Broadcast Pvt. Ltd. vide certificate No. 08 to 11 all dated
        18th March of 2021…”.
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 327 of 549
   657.                     She also identifies the signatures of PW-16 Sh. Pankaj
        Arora and Smt. Arpita Arora on these share certificates in their
        capacity as Director and authorised signatories. Thus, the documentary
        record unequivocally establishes that as on 18.03.2021, the
        shareholding position of Zeus Networking Pvt. Ltd. stood formally
        recorded and crystallised.

   658.                     Thereafter, both PW-15 and PW-16 speak to the
        commencement of acquisition of shares by A-4 and A-5 through deeds
        of pledge, beginning immediately after the issuance of the share
        certificates. PW-16 Sh. Pankaj Arora states in clear terms: “….On
        being asked I state that three deeds of pledge executed between
        Director of CDG Broadcast Pvt. Ltd. i.e. me and my wife Ms. Arpita
        Arora and the Acquirer of shares of company Zeus Networking Pvt.
        Ltd. vide deeds of pledge dated 24.03.2021, 23.08.2021 and
        29.09.2021….”.

   659.                  He further explains the nature of the transaction by stating:
        “...Director of Zeus Networking Pvt. Ltd. pledge shares to the
        acquirers i.e. Mr. Mootha Gautam and Mr. Abhishek Boinpally equal
        to the amount received from them….”.

   660.                     PW-15 corroborates this position by identifying the
        same set of pledge deeds and signatures, thereby confirming that the
        acquisition process was structured through recognised corporate
        instruments and unfolded over a defined timeline commencing from
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 328 of 549
        24.03.2021. As regards consideration, PW-15 identifies the consent
        documents permitting sale of shares and records:

                “...Director of CDG Broadcast Pvt. Ltd. has signed consent
                letter for disposing of / selling of 30,00,000 (98.36%) shares of
                CDG Broadcast Limited holding in Zeus Networking Pvt. Ltd.
                on an agreed value of Rs. 5.70 Crores….”.
   661.                     Neither PW-15 nor PW-16 attributes the movement of
        consideration to any cash transaction or informal channel. On the
        contrary, the witnesses consistently speak to the transaction having
        been carried out through banking channels, supported by corporate
        approvals, consent letters, pledge deeds and share certificates.

   662.                     What emerges from the above evidence is a continuous
        and documented corporate transaction, commencing with issuance of
        share certificates on 18.03.2021, followed by execution of pledge
        deeds beginning 24.03.2021, and culminating in eventual transfer of
        shares. This entire sequence preceded by the alleged meeting and
        alleged hatching of conspiracy relied upon by the prosecution.

   663.                     In this backdrop, the prosecution’s theory that the
        acquisition of Zeus Networking Pvt. Ltd. was a product of a later
        conspiracy or a mechanism for layering of alleged proceeds of crime
        is rendered fundamentally flawed. The very foundation of the alleged
        layering collapses when the prosecution’s own relied-upon witnesses
        demonstrate that the acquisition process was already underway
        through formal corporate documentation and regulated banking

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 329 of 549
        transactions much prior to the alleged conspiratorial period. The
        evidence of PW-15 and PW-16, far from supporting the prosecution
        narrative, instead discloses a pre-existing commercial transaction,
        thereby striking at the core of the allegation that the acquisition of
        Zeus Networking Pvt. Ltd. was conceived or executed as part of any
        criminal conspiracy.

        (D) Examination of Trademark Acquisition in the Context of the
        Alleged Recoupment Theory

   664.                     The record reflects that the trademark “India Ahead”,
        together with its goodwill, was transferred by A-6 (APPL) to A-4 for
        a consideration of Rs. 1.30 crores through a duly executed and
        registered Assignment Deed dated 10.06.2022 (D-87) and Invoice
        dated 31.07.2021. The consideration moved through normal banking
        channels and the transaction is supported by formal documentation.
        On the face of it, the arrangement bears the character of a commercial
        transfer of intellectual property.

   665.                     The prosecution has attempted to suggest that this
        transaction was a means for recoupment of alleged amounts through
        A6. However, the contemporaneous material does not support such a
        conclusion. The financial dealings between A4 and A6 commenced in
        October 2020, which is prior to the period during which the alleged
        Excise Policy conspiracy is projected to have taken shape. The initial
        advancement of funds thus precedes the alleged policy deliberations.
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 330 of 549
        The sequence of events does not lend any support to the inference that
        the trademark acquisition was conceived as part of a recoupment
        mechanism connected to a later alleged conspiracy.

   666.                     When the transactions are considered cumulatively,
        beginning with the infusion of funds, followed by the acquisition of
        the “India Ahead” intellectual property, and thereafter the acquisition
        of ZNPL, they indicate a consistent commercial course of conduct.
        The record shows that A-4 was exploring entry into the media and
        broadcasting sector, and the steps taken were accompanied by formal
        instruments, banking entries and regulatory compliances. Such
        features are consistent with a bona fide business arrangement.

   667.                     Notably, there is no material on record showing any
        nexus between the acquisition of the trademark and alleged
        recoupment from M/S Indospirit. No document, correspondence or
        witness statement connects this transaction with the liquor business or
        with any understanding under the Excise Policy. In the absence of such
        linkage, the allegation rests on assumption. The material presently
        available points to a commercial transaction rather than to a device for
        recoupment within the alleged conspiracy.

        (E) Advance Payment for Proposed Marketing Campaign by A-5 to
        A-6
   668.                     The prosecution alleges that the remittance of Rs. 1.70
        crores by A5 to entities connected with A-6, Rs. 1 crore to APPL on
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 331 of 549
        28.02.2022 and Rs. 70 lakhs to IANPL on 14.03.2022, was not towards
        any genuine marketing campaign but formed part of the alleged larger
        conspiracy. This allegation is founded principally on two
        circumstances: first, that unlike earlier campaigns executed by APPL
        for clients such as GoDaddy and Sporta Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
        (Dream11), no formal written agreement has been placed on record in
        the case of M/S Indospirits; and second, that the payment was made in
        advance, whereas in earlier assignments payments were structured
        after execution. On this basis, the transaction is described as lacking
        commercial substance.

   669.                     On scrutiny, the allegation does not advance the
        prosecution case. It is not in dispute that the amounts were transferred
        through regular banking channels. The record further shows that
        concept papers relating to the proposed campaign were prepared and
        later produced before the investigating agency under Production
        Memo dated 08.11.2022 (D-89, Pgs. 6783–6796). The existence of
        these contemporaneous documents is of relevance and supports the
        position that preparatory steps had in fact been taken.

   670.                     The absence of a formal written agreement between
        private parties, by itself, does not render a commercial transaction
        unlawful. Business engagements are often initiated on the basis of
        mutual understanding, particularly where advance consideration is
        paid and preliminary work begins pending formal documentation.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                    Page no. 332 of 549
        There is no statutory requirement that payment for services must
        invariably follow completion of work. Advance payments are a
        recognised feature of commercial practice, and the timing or structure
        of payment depends upon the arrangement between the parties. A
        difference in payment modality, when compared with other
        transactions, cannot by itself justify an inference of criminality.

   671.                     No material has been placed on record to indicate that
        the funds were diverted, concealed, or applied for any unlawful
        purpose. The preparation of campaign documents, traceable to specific
        records, further belies the suggestion of a sham arrangement. If the
        payment had no underlying commercial intent, there would have been
        little occasion to prepare and preserve detailed concept material.

                                                              (emphasis supplied)

   672.                     The non-execution of the campaign is explained by the
        subsequent arraignment of A-5 in the present case. A commercial
        proposal that does not culminate in execution due to intervening events
        cannot, without more, be treated as evidence of conspiracy. The mere
        fact that a project did not fructify does not retrospectively alter the
        character of an advance payment.

   673.                     On the material presently available, the transaction
        reflects a proposed commercial engagement supported by banking
        entries and contemporaneous documentation. No material has been


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 333 of 549
        brought on record to establish a nexus between this payment and the
        alleged Excise Policy conspiracy. The inference suggested by the
        prosecution is not supported by demonstrable material.

        (F) Presence of A-5 and A-6 in the Meeting at Gauri Apartments

   674.                     The allegation regarding the inception of the conspiracy
        at Gauri Apartments has already been examined in detail. Even at the
        cost of repetition, the present discussion is confined to the role
        attributed to A-4 and A-5 in that meeting.

   675.                     The prosecution relies upon three participants as its
        witnesses, namely PW-1, PW-2 and the approver PW-20. The specific
        allegation against A-4, A-5 and A-11 is that they were discussing the
        taking of five to ten retail zones. It is further stated that PW-1 and
        PW-2 could assist in setting up the shops and providing staff for
        running them. In return, assistance would be extended to promote the
        brand “Royal Green” at such outlets and to facilitate its sale in the
        Telangana market.

   676.                     Read in context, these statements indicate that certain
        private individuals were contemplating entry into the retail liquor
        business, with an intention to secure retail zones and arrange
        manpower if such entry materialised. A discussion about the number
        of retail zones and the requirement of staff is, by its nature, preparatory
        and commercial. It does not, by itself, disclose a criminal design.


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 334 of 549
   677.                     Even if the prosecution case is accepted at its highest, it
        is not shown that either A-4 or A-5 applied for any retail zone under
        the DEP-21/22. There is no material to suggest that they secured any
        licence, participated in the bidding process, or undertook any retail
        operations pursuant to the policy. The record does not reflect their
        involvement in the retail segment in any tangible manner.

   678.                     Equally important is the absence of any allegation in
        these discussions of policy manipulation, influence over decision-
        making, quid pro quo, or bribery. There is no reference to altering the
        Excise Policy, no assertion of illegal gratification, and no material
        suggesting that the conversation travelled beyond a proposed
        commercial arrangement.

   679.                     At best, what emerges is that certain business persons
        were exploring the possibility of entering a regulated trade and were
        discussing logistical aspects such as staffing and brand promotion. In
        the absence of any material linking such discussions to unlawful acts
        or corrupt intent, the allegation does not rise beyond a prospective
        business proposal.

        (G) Meeting at ITC Kohinoor, Hyderabad — Alleged Finalisation of
        Conspiracy and Mode of Recoupment
   680.                     The prosecution case, in its simplest articulation, is that
        the meeting held on 19.06.2021 at ITC Kohinoor, Hyderabad,
        constituted the stage at which the alleged conspiracy attained finality

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 335 of 549
        in terms of structure and execution. It is alleged that the wholesale
        profit margin under the L-1 licence was enhanced from 5% to 12%
        with a predetermined objective, that out of the enhanced 12% margin,
        6% would be siphoned as “upfront money” for the benefit of A-3. The
        two wholesale entities projected as instrumental in this arrangement
        are M/S Indospirit (associated with A-7) and M/S BPSL (associated
        with A-9).

   681.                     According to the prosecution, the mechanism of
        recoupment differed between the two entities. In the case of M/S
        Indospirit, the recovery of the alleged upfront component is stated to
        have been effected through transfer or routing of profits to A-5. In the
        case of BPSL, the alleged recovery was to be achieved by issuance of
        additional credit notes to retail zones purportedly controlled by the so-
        called “South Group”. Thus, the entire architecture of enhancement,
        payment of upfront money, and subsequent recoupment is stated to
        have been crystallised in the Hyderabad meeting.

   682.                     The principal foundation for this narrative rests upon the
        statement of approver PW-20, who admittedly attended the said
        meeting. The investigating agency has relied upon three statements of
        PW-20: (i) his statement under Section 161 of Cr.P.C dated
        21.09.2022, (ii) his statement under Section 164 of Cr.P.C dated
        30.09.2022 (pre-pardon), and (iii) his post-pardon confessional
        statement recorded under Section 306(4) of Cr.P.C dated 24.11.2022.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 336 of 549
   683.                     A comparative reading of these statements reveals
        variations in figures, description of the mechanism, and attribution of
        knowledge. However, at the stage of framing of charge, this Court does
        not embark upon a minute dissection of inconsistencies unless they are
        of such magnitude as to completely demolish the substratum of the
        prosecution case. The statements of approver PW-20 are the basis on
        which the prosecution has built its case of enhancement of margin,
        division of 6% out of 12%, and utilisation of Indospirit and BPSL as
        vehicles of recoupment.

   684.                     Yet, an important nuance emerges. The alleged modus
        operandi, as narrated by PW-20, is largely premised upon what was
        conveyed to him by A-3. Though he was physically present in the
        meeting, the structure of profit distribution and recovery is not
        consistently attributed to his personal knowledge. In one version, he
        states that A-3 informed him; in another, he suggests that the “South
        investors” explained the arrangement somewhere after the retail vends
        were not being opened, which must be the period after bidding of retail
        zones; and in yet another, he presents the structure as told by A-3. This
        shift assumes significance because, if his confessional statements as
        well as statement under Section 161 are accepted in their entirety, the
        knowledge of the finalised conspiracy, particularly its financial
        structuring, appears to be derived from what was told to him rather



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                     Page no. 337 of 549
        than from acts personally executed or observed by him in the
        meeting.

   685.                     This does not directly affect the acts allegedly performed
        by PW-20 in furtherance of the conspiracy, such as coordination of
        payments.           However,     it   renders   the   confessional     narrative
        comparatively fragile in so far as the conceptual architecture of the
        conspiracy is concerned. The tender of pardon was premised upon the
        expectation of a full and true disclosure. While this Court does not, at
        this juncture, enter into an adjudication on the truthfulness of the
        disclosure, it is evident from the recording of supplementary
        statements under Section 161 of Cr.P.C that the narrative evolved over
        time. Whether such evolution constitutes incompleteness or otherwise,
        nevertheless, it reinforces the settled rule of prudence that accomplice
        evidence requires independent corroboration on material particulars
        before it can safely be acted upon.

   686.                     The necessity of corroboration is accentuated in the
        present case, particularly in light of the multiple supplementary
        statements recorded by the investigating officer and the progressive
        refinement of the alleged modus operandi. The meeting at ITC
        Kohinoor, though attended by PW-20, is, in part, presented through a
        lens of information conveyed to him. It is conceivable that he
        articulated the events in a manner that minimised his participatory



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 338 of 549
        role; equally, it is possible that he narrated what was explained to
        him.

   687.                     Even so, at the present stage, this Court proceeds on the
        footing most favourable to the prosecution. Without discarding the
        statement of the approver, it is provisionally treated as a complete and
        truthful disclosure for the limited purpose of examining whether the
        alleged modus operandi coheres with the surrounding circumstances.
        The analysis, therefore, shall proceed in two distinct but interrelated
        dimensions:

                            First, on a factual plane, whether the enhancement of
        wholesale margin, the alleged payment of upfront money, the
        projected modes of recoupment through Indospirit and BPSL, the
        movement of funds to Delhi and thereafter to Goa, and the alleged
        utilisation in electoral activity, collectively form a chain consistent
        with the modus operandi described.

                            Second, on the evidentiary plane, whether this central
        component of the prosecution case, namely the finalisation of the
        conspiracy and its financial structure at the Hyderabad meeting, stands
        independently corroborated on material particulars beyond the
        uncorroborated word of the approver.

   688.                     It is only after applying both tests that a holistic view
        can be formed as to whether the prosecution’s projected


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 339 of 549
        circumstances, if assumed to be true at this stage, reasonably advance
        the alleged design or whether the edifice rests primarily upon
        uncorroborated accomplice statement. This exercise is confined to an
        even more superficial scrutiny than a prima facie assessment, limited
        to the allegations concerning what is stated to have transpired at the
        meeting at ITC Kohinoor, Hyderabad.
                                                               (emphasis supplied)

   689.                     On the first aspect, the documentary trail itself raises
        serious doubt about the alleged finalisation of a conspiratorial design
        at the ITC Kohinoor meeting. It is the prosecution case that a 36-page
        document was handed over by members of the so-called South Group,
        namely A-4, A-5, A-11 and A-23, with A-4, A-5 and A-11 acting on
        behalf of A-17, and that this document formed the basis of the second
        draft GoM Report dated 19.03.2021. However, a plain reading of the
        second draft indicates that it contained provisions which, on the
        prosecution’s own theory, would operate against the interest of the
        alleged conspirators. The clause limiting the wholesale margin to 12%
        stands in contrast to the first draft GoM Report dated 15.03.2021,
        which, far from fixing the margin at 5% as is now sought to be
        suggested, merely prescribed a minimum of 5% without any upper
        cap. The absence of a ceiling in the first draft would have enabled the
        margin to rise beyond 12%, thereby potentially conferring greater
        commercial advantage upon any wholesaler. If the “South Group”

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 340 of 549
        were indeed shaping the policy for their own enrichment, it is difficult
        to reconcile why they would introduce a restrictive ceiling of 12%,
        instead of retaining the open-ended formulation that could have
        yielded greater profit.

   690.                     Similarly, the clause enhancing the turnover requirement
        of ₹500 crores per year for the past five years would have had the
        direct consequence of placing M/S Indospirit outside the zone of
        eligibility for the L-1 licence. Such a stipulation would hardly advance
        the interest of the very entity through which, according to the
        prosecution, the recoupment mechanism was to operate. On the
        prosecution’s narrative, the “South Group” was acting in concert to
        secure advantage through Indospirit; yet the very draft attributed to
        them incorporates conditions detrimental to that objective. The
        internal logic of the conspiracy theory thus begins to unravel on its
        own terms.

   691.                     The prosecution case in the main charge-sheet projected
        the genesis of conspiracy as commencing in April/May. Subsequently,
        the narrative was shifted backward to March, with the allegation that
        A-4, A-5 and A-11 were acting as conduits of A-17 during the drafting
        stage itself. This alteration is not a mere refinement of detail; it re-
        anchors the entire conspiracy at an earlier point in time. Such
        repositioning, when viewed alongside the contents of the March draft
        itself, renders the theory self-contradictory.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 341 of 549
   692.                     The position becomes even more untenable at the stage
        of implementation. It is an admitted fact that M/S KGRL failed in the
        first bidding round. More importantly, M/S Indospirit initially filed its
        application dated 09.09.2021 for grant of L-1 licence without any
        accused belonging to the South Group as partner, which stands in clear
        contrast to what is alleged to have been decided in the meeting at ITC
        Kohinoor, Hyderabad. This aspect assumes decisive significance in
        light of the post-pardon confessional statement of PW-20, wherein he
        stated: “There were two L-1. (1) M/S Indospirits, 65% partnership
        will be of Arun Pillai, who was with Abhishek and 35% will be of
        Sameer Mahendroo.”

   693.                     Contrary to this assertion, the initial application was
        filed by M/S IMPL (JV), with IMPL and IMDL as partners. The very
        persons projected in the alleged modus operandi as recipients and
        vehicles of recoupment were not part of the original application
        structure. If the conspiracy stood crystallised in June with a defined
        recovery mechanism through specific partners, their absence from the
        foundational application strikes at the root of the projected design.

   694.                     An equally significant omission relates to approver
        Raghav Magunta (PW-226), who, as per the prosecution, had already
        paid ₹25 crores as upfront money. The charge-sheet subsequently
        introduces Prem Rahul Manduri (PW-270) as a proxy of PW-226 and
        as a partner in M/S Indospirit. Yet there is no reference to this

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 342 of 549
        arrangement in the alleged meeting at Hyderabad, nor does it form part
        of the articulated modus operandi described by PW-20. When both the
        payment of upfront money and the corresponding mode of recoupment
        fail to find structural consistency with the contemporaneous record,
        the discussion does not even superficially cross the threshold of a
        prima facie case.
                                                                (emphasis supplied)

   695.                     On the second aspect, it is well settled that the statement
        of an approver can be acted upon only when it receives corroboration
        in material particulars. In the present case, there is no independent
        witness examined to substantiate the alleged finalisation of the modus
        operandi at the Hyderabad meeting. PW-1 has candidly stated that
        though he was present at the venue, he was asked to leave before any
        substantive discussion took place. His evidence, therefore, can at best
        corroborate the factum of the meeting; it does not and cannot
        corroborate the alleged financial structuring or recoupment
        mechanism.

   696.                     This assumes greater significance when the confessional
        statements of PW-20 themselves create the impression that the
        financial architecture was narrated to him by others. To that extent, his
        account borders on hearsay regarding the design of the conspiracy,
        even though he may have participated in certain acts thereafter. When
        the central plank of the prosecution, namely, the finalisation of

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 343 of 549
        enhancement, upfront payment and recoupment, rests upon such
        statements, the absence of independent corroboration in material
        particulars becomes a serious infirmity.

   697.                     Thus, both on the internal consistency of the projected
        modus operandi and on the evidentiary requirement of corroboration,
        the prosecution case encounters substantial difficulty at its very
        foundation, and this Court has no hesitation in observing that it does
        not even superficially disclose a prima facie case.

        (H) Alleged Role of A-4 and A-5 in the 36-Page Printout and the
        Second Draft GoM Report dated 19.03.2021
   698.                     The prosecution has laid considerable emphasis on the
        allegation that members of the so-called “South Group”, particularly
        A-4 and A-5, stayed at Hotel Oberoi between 14.03.2021 and
        17.03.2021 and, during this period, caused a 36-page document to be
        printed. It is alleged that this document was handed over to A-3,
        thereafter reaching A-8, and that it ultimately formed the foundation
        of the second draft of the GoM Report dated 19.03.2021. This issue
        has already been examined in detail in paragraphs 326 to 339, wherein
        the material on record and the sequence of events were analysed clause
        by clause.

   699.                     As noted in the earlier discussion, the clauses contained
        in the second draft GoM Report do not, on their plain reading, reflect
        any structural advantage to M/S Indospirit. On the contrary, certain
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 344 of 549
        conditions incorporated in the draft, most notably the requirement of a
        minimum turnover of ₹500 crores per annum for the preceding five
        financial years, would, if applied, have rendered M/S Indospirit
        ineligible for consideration of an L-1 licence. It is not disputed that
        A-5 was a partner in M/S Indospirit. The record further indicates that
        even when the eligibility threshold was subsequently reduced to ₹150
        crores per annum for the preceding three years, the entity faced
        difficulty in meeting the criteria and securing the L-1 licence.

   700.                     In this context, the prosecution’s narrative presents an
        inherent inconsistency. If A-5 was indeed acting with the object of
        securing benefit for M/S Indospirit and facilitating recoupment of
        alleged “upfront money”, it is difficult to reconcile such an objective
        with the introduction or endorsement of a clause that effectively
        disqualified the very entity in which he held a partnership interest. A
        turnover requirement of ₹500 crores for five years operates as an
        exclusionary condition. It does not appear tailored to advance M/S
        Indospirit’s eligibility; rather, it places it outside the zone of
        consideration. No satisfactory explanation has been offered as to why
        a participant in the alleged conspiracy would support a stipulation
        detrimental to his own firm.

   701.                     The prosecution nevertheless seeks to rely upon the
        subsequent receipt of ₹29.29 crores by A-5 as profit from M/S
        Indospirit, projecting it as indicative of recoupment and as lending

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 345 of 549
        support to the broader conspiracy theory. However, profit distribution
        within a partnership, in the absence of material demonstrating an
        unlawful source or a direct nexus between the impugned policy clause
        and the alleged gain, cannot by itself sustain such an inference. When
        the chronology of events and the substantive content of the draft
        clauses are considered alongside the financial position of M/S
        Indospirit at the relevant time, the allegation that the 36-page
        document was conceived as an instrument of preferential treatment or
        structured recoupment does not withstand close scrutiny.

   702.                     It has already been discussed that the alleged printout
        taken from Hotel Oberoi is stated to be of 36 pages, whereas the
        Second GoM Report runs into 38 pages. The prosecution attempts to
        reconcile this difference by suggesting that if the first and last pages
        are excluded, the remaining 36 pages correspond to the printout. On
        that basis, it is argued that certain pages were handed over to the
        Personal Secretary and thereafter to the stenographer for typing,
        thereby connecting the hotel printout with the Second GoM draft.

   703.                     This reasoning does not withstand scrutiny. The printout
        itself was never recovered. In the absence of the original document,
        identity cannot be established merely by referring to the number of
        pages. A document is proved by its contents, not by arithmetic. Even
        if two documents contain an equal number of pages, that by itself does
        not establish that they are identical.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 346 of 549
   704.                     The prosecution’s own witnesses on this aspect, PW-71
        and PW-72, do not support the present theory. PW-71 has stated that
        the document was around 20–25 pages. PW-72 has stated that it was
        approximately 25–30 pages. Neither witness refers to a 36-page
        document. If these two witnesses are relied upon as independent links
        in the chain, their statements assume significance. Their version is
        plainly inconsistent with the suggestion that the printout was of 36
        pages.

   705.                     When the page count spoken to by the witnesses does
        not match the figure now sought to be relied upon, the foundation itself
        gets eorded. The attempt to equate a supposed 36-page printout with a
        38-page draft by excluding two pages is, at best, speculative,
        particularly when the primary document is not before the Court.

   706.                     In these circumstances, the theory advanced by the
        prosecution stands contradicted by its own evidence. After examining
        the statements of PW-71 and PW-72, it ought to have been apparent
        that the allegation lacked factual support. The introduction of such an
        allegation, unsupported by the prosecution’s own witnesses, gives rise
        to a legitimate concern that it was inserted to cast a cloud over the
        process and to create an impression of impropriety. Sensationalism can
        never be the objective of an investigating agency. The sole object of
        investigation must remain the discovery of truth.

                                                              (emphasis supplied)

        (I) Alleged Proxy Induction of A-5 and Recoupment Theory —
        Assessment in the Context of Profit Distribution and larger
        conspiracy.
   707.                     The controversy regarding the transfer of approximately
        61% of the profits from M/S Indospirit to A-5 has already been
        comprehensively addressed. Even at the cost of repetition, it is
        observed that on examination of the contemporaneous record,
        particularly Document D-9 and the Joint Venture Agreement, it was
        found that the routing of profits was founded on a prior mutual
        understanding among the partners, was consensual in nature, and was
        not shown to contravene any statutory provision, contractual
        restriction, or clause of the Excise Policy. No material was identified
        to suggest clandestine diversion, illegality, or linkage with any act of
        corruption. The legal position under the Partnership Act and the
        Evidence Act was also analysed, and it was concluded that
        disproportionate distribution of profits, by itself, does not attract
        criminality in the absence of a demonstrated illegal source or causal
        nexus with an unlawful act.

   708.                     Even so, when the matter is revisited from the standpoint
        of alleged conspiracy, the prosecution’s further projection requires
        scrutiny. It has been suggested that the induction of A-5 into the
        partnership of M/S Indospirit was engineered on the premise that he
        was merely a nominee or front for A-17 (K. Kavitha) and that the
        substantial portion of profits routed to him represented recoupment for

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 348 of 549
        her benefit. This assertion, though pressed with emphasis, is
        unsupported by any material demonstrating that A-5 held his interest
        benami or that the profits credited to him were ever transferred
        onward, shared with, or placed under the dominion or control of A-17
        (K. Kavitha). There is no documentary trail, banking evidence,
        communication, or witness statement establishing any obligation on
        his part to account for such profits to her. A theory of recoupment
        necessarily presupposes proof of the onward flow of funds to the
        alleged ultimate beneficiary. In the absence of even a specific
        allegation identifying the manner, mode, or occasion of such transfer,
        much less proof thereof, the proxy narrative remains without factual
        foundation.

   709.                     It is true that conspiracies are seldom proved by direct
        evidence and may legitimately be inferred from surrounding
        circumstances. However, such inference must arise from a firmly
        established chain of material facts pointing towards a meeting of
        minds and a shared unlawful object. Each link in that chain must be
        supported by tangible evidence, and the cumulative circumstances
        must reasonably exclude an innocent explanation. The mere fact that
        profits accrued in a particular proportion, or that one partner received
        a dominant share, does not by itself constitute evidence of conspiracy
        in the absence of proof that the income was illegally generated or
        diverted. Criminal liability cannot be inferred from commercial

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 349 of 549
        structuring alone. Where contemporaneous documentation reflects a
        lawful and consensual arrangement, and where no material connects
        the impugned profits to the alleged beneficiary, the superimposition of
        a conspiracy theory rests on suspicion rather than substantiated
        inference and does not disclose even a prima facie case.

        (J) Allegation against A-4 for Coordinating the Amount Received from
        Approver PW-226

   710.                     Upon a conjoint reading of the main charge-sheet as well
        as the supplementary charge-sheets, the prosecution case emerges to
        the effect that the alleged “upfront money” was initially generated by
        the so-called South Group, transferred to Delhi, and thereafter routed
        to Goa through hawala channels with the assistance of Angadia
        operators. The total quantum of such alleged illegal gratification is
        projected to be in the range of ₹90–100 crores. Out of this amount, a
        sum of ₹44.5 crores is stated to have been transported to Goa and
        attributed to A-16.

   711.                     Significantly, out of the aforesaid ₹44.5 crores, an
        amount of ₹25 crores is alleged to be the very sum paid by the
        approver PW-226 at the instance of A-17, K. Kavitha. As per the
        prosecution, this ₹25 crores moved from PW-226 through PW-227
        (stated to be a Personal Assistant at the Chennai office) to certain
        unidentified persons. At this juncture, the chain of movement
        admittedly breaks. Thereafter, the prosecution seeks to re-commence
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 350 of 549
        a separate chain, allegedly beginning from Delhi, tracing movement
        of cash through Dinesh Arora (PW-20), Ashok Kaushik (PW-195),
        Vinod Chandel (A-21), Mohit (A-22), Chandan Mishra (Angadia,
        Delhi), and thereafter through an Angadia firm (Kantilal group), via
        PW-180 (Sagar Patel), culminating in alleged delivery to A-16.

   712.                     The specific allegation against A-4 is that, out of the said
        ₹25 crores, he personally coordinated a sum of ₹15 crores forming
        part of the amount allegedly paid by PW-226.

   713.                     The approver PW-20, in his statement, asserts that the
        cash amount constituting the alleged “upfront money” reached Delhi
        through hawala channels. However, the material on record is
        conspicuously silent as to any evidentiary link demonstrating that the
        amount allegedly paid at Chennai by PW-226 was ever transported to
        Delhi. In the absence of any such material, a fundamental question
        arises as to how it can be assumed that the amount which allegedly
        reached Goa was the very same amount paid by PW-226.

   714.                     This lacuna assumes heightened significance for the
        additional reason that PW-227 has failed to disclose essential
        particulars such as the place, date, mode, identity of the recipient, or
        even the phone numbers involved in the alleged payment of ₹15
        crores. The prosecution material is entirely silent on these foundational
        aspects.


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                            Page no. 351 of 549
   715.                     It is no doubt settled that, at the stage of charge, even a
        broken or incomplete chain may, in a given case, be sufficient for
        consideration. However, where the witnesses relied upon are
        themselves participants in the alleged movement of large cash
        amounts, having admittedly aided the purported conspiracy by acts of
        abetment, their statement cannot be treated as independent
        corroboration of the approver PW-226 on material particulars. Such
        witnesses fall within the category of accomplice-like witnesses, whose
        statements require independent corroboration from unimpeachable
        material. It is also well settled that one accomplice cannot corroborate
        another. Reliance is placed upon the judgments of Hon’ble Supreme
        Court in K. Hashim (supra), Somasundaram (supra), Laxmipat
        Choraria (supra) and A.R. Antulay (supra).

   716.                     The deficiency becomes more pronounced when it is
        noticed that there is not a single statement of any Angadia or
        intermediary who allegedly transferred the sum of ₹25 crores from
        Chennai to Delhi. The absence of such evidence is material,
        particularly because this ₹25 crores is the sole amount which the
        prosecution seeks to connect directly to the South Group through the
        statement of PW-226.

   717.                     It is this very amount which the prosecution alleges was
        decided upon in the meeting dated 18.06.2021 at ITC Kohinoor,
        Hyderabad, where it is claimed that a sum ranging between ₹20–30

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 352 of 549
        crores was to be paid by A-4 (South Group) to A-3. However, even
        this allegation suffers from material inconsistencies. In the main
        charge-sheet, the period of payment is projected as July to September,
        whereas in the supplementary charge-sheet, the timeline is shifted to
        June. Further, the payment allegedly made by PW-226 through
        PW-227 is stated to comprise ₹10 crores in March and ₹15 crores in
        June.

   718.                     The prosecution material is conspicuously silent on the
        identity of the person who received the alleged cash, the manner of its
        delivery, and the route by which it allegedly reached Delhi. Despite
        this, the prosecution projects this chain as the only “complete” chain
        connecting the South Group to the alleged funds reaching Goa.

   719.                     In the absence of evidence any material continuity of
        movement, identity of recipients, corroboration by independent
        intermediaries, or documentary support for inter-city transfer of cash,
        the prosecution’s theory of movement of proceeds of crime rests on
        assumptions and inferential leaps rather than legally admissible
        material. Consequently, the alleged linkage between the payment
        attributed to PW-226, including the ₹15 crores alleged to have been
        coordinated by A-4, and the funds allegedly reaching Goa through
        Delhi remains unsubstantiated and incapable of sustaining a prima
        facie inference of a continuous, unified money trail.

        (K) Impleadment of A-6, Mootha Gautham
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 353 of 549
   720.                     In this factual backdrop, the Court finds no legally
        sustainable basis for impleading A-6 as an accused. The prosecution
        does not allege that he participated in the conspiracy, nor does it
        attribute to him knowledge of the alleged conspiracy or awareness that
        the monies received by him were tainted. The sole circumstance relied
        upon is receipt of funds through disclosed banking channels. In the
        absence of any allegation of mens rea, agreement, or conscious
        facilitation, such material is insufficient to attract criminal liability.
        The impleadment of A-6 has, in turn, subjected media entities, IANPL
        and APPL, to extensive investigative scrutiny without any
        foundational material demonstrating their nexus with the alleged
        excise policy conspiracy. The investigation appears to have expanded
        beyond its legitimate scope, converting ordinary commercial and
        media transactions into objects of criminal suspicion without
        establishing the essential ingredients of any offence.

   721.                     When the above material is read as a whole, two features
        stand out:               (i) the prosecution challenges ordinary private
        documentation                 on     a    legally     incorrect           premise
        (registration/notarisation), and (ii) the prosecution simultaneously
        ignores its own chronology showing pre-existing investment intent
        (October 2020), pre-existing transactions (from 10.11.2020), and
        continous and documented corporate transactions beginning, well
        before the alleged conspiracy is said to have taken shape. The narrative

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                            Page no. 354 of 549
        now projected is, therefore, not an inference flowing from evidence; it
        is a post-facto construction which attempts to fit pre-existing
        commercial activity into a conspiracy framework by reversing the
        sequence of events. Such an approach does not assist the Court; it risks
        misleading the Court into treating chronology-defying suspicion as
        incriminating material. At the stage of framing of charge, conjecture
        and narrative cannot substitute for legally admissible circumstances
        disclosing the ingredients of the alleged offences.

        Allegation against A-9

   722.                     The prosecution attributes to A-9 (Amandeep Singh
        Dhall) a role in the alleged conspiracy on the premise that Brindco
        Sales Pvt. Ltd. (BSPL), as a wholesaler, issued credit notes, trade
        incentives and other commercial adjustments to retail licensees, which
        are alleged to have functioned as a conduit for generation and layering
        of illicit funds linked to the DEP-21/22. It is further alleged that these
        mechanisms facilitated undue benefit to select retail entities and were
        utilised, directly or indirectly, for diversion of funds towards political
        purposes, including the Goa Assembly Elections 2022.

   723.                     The case against A-9, as projected, does not rest on any
        allegation of his participation in policy formulation or interaction with
        public servants at the decision-making stage. Rather, it proceeds on an
        inference drawn from post-policy commercial transactions undertaken
        by M/S BSPL in the course of wholesale operations, sought to be
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 355 of 549
        characterised as being in furtherance of the larger conspiracy. The
        prosecution seeks to rely on accounting entries, credit-note data and
        statements of approvers and corporate witnesses to suggest that M/S
        BSPL’s commercial practices were not merely market-driven but were
        designed to camouflage proceeds of crime.

        Analysis

        (i) Alleged Presence of A-9 in the Meeting at Gauri Apartment

   724.                     The prosecution alleges that a meeting was held at Gauri
        Apartment, Delhi on 21.05.2021. In support of the occurrence of the
        said meeting, reliance is primarily placed upon the statements of PW-1
        and PW-2. However, a close and careful reading of their statements
        reveals that neither PW-1 nor PW-2 has named or referred to the
        presence of A-9 at the said meeting. The approver, PW-20, who is
        projected by the prosecution as a pivotal witness and whose statements
        form the backbone of the prosecution narrative, has also not stated
        anything to suggest the presence or participation of A-9 in the said
        meeting.

   725.                     The investigating agency has nonetheless sought to
        project that, during the said meeting, discussions took place to the
        effect that A-9 would issue credit notes to retail zones allegedly
        controlled by the so-called “South Group”. This assertion, however,
        stands in stark contrast to the prosecution’s own version as set out in


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 356 of 549
        the main charge-sheet. In the main charge-sheet, while referring to the
        meeting at Gauri Apartment, it is specifically stated that the meeting
        was attended by Accused Nos. A-3, A-10, A-4 and A-5, along with
        PW-1, PW-2 and approver PW-20. The omission of A-9 from this list
        is not incidental, but conspicuous. The alleged presence of A-9 thus
        finds no support from the statements of PW-1, PW-2 or PW-20, all of
        whom are prosecution witnesses and are stated to have been present
        and participating in the meeting.

   726.                     It assumes significance that the prosecution itself places
        substantial reliance on the statements of approver PW-20, including
        his statements recorded under Sections 161 and 164 of Cr.P.C. as well
        as under Section 306(4)/306(6) of CrPC after tender of pardon, which
        the investigating agency asserts to be a “full and true disclosure”.
        Despite multiple statements made by PW-20 at different stages, there
        is a complete absence of any assertion regarding the presence, role or
        involvement of A-9 in the said meeting. In this factual backdrop, the
        subsequent attempt by the prosecution to establish the presence of A-9
        solely on the basis of mobile phone tower-location data warrants close
        judicial scrutiny.

   727.                     The central question that arises is whether, in the face of
        categorical statements of the alleged participants of the meeting, who
        neither name A-9 nor attribute any role to him, the prosecution can
        nonetheless rely upon tower-location data to assert his presence. The

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 357 of 549
        answer must necessarily be in the negative. Tower-location evidence,
        by its very nature, is incapable of pinpointing the precise physical
        location of a mobile phone or its user. Such evidence, at best, indicates
        a broad geographical area and cannot override direct oral statement of
        witnesses who were admittedly present at the meeting. Reliance on
        tower-location data, particularly when it runs contrary to the
        prosecution’s own primary and star witnesses, does not advance the
        prosecution case and, in fact, erodes its internal consistency. At the
        stage of framing of charge, such material does not meet the threshold
        required to sustain the allegation of A-9’s participation in the
        meeting.

   728.                     The shift in the prosecution’s stand from the main
        charge-sheet to the first supplementary charge-sheet is also of
        considerable relevance. The apparent necessity to introduce tower-
        location evidence to show the presence of A-9 indicates that, without
        such a projection, the subsequent allegation relating to issuance of
        credit notes to the South Group could not be connected to the alleged
        meeting or brought within the fold of the conspiracy narrative. The
        absence of A-9 from the said meeting, as borne out from the statements
        of PW-1, PW-2 and PW-20, renders the foundational premise of
        conspiracy qua A-9 legally tenuous and factually unsupported, even
        on the standard applicable at the stage of charge.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                     Page no. 358 of 549
   729.                     It is further material to note that none of the witnesses
        stated to be present at the meeting have spoken about any discussion
        relating to recoupment of alleged “upfront money” through issuance
        of credit notes. On the contrary, the discussion, as emerging from the
        statements on record, was confined to issues relating to taking of retail
        zones and arrangement of manpower for running the retail vends. This
        assumes importance, as the prosecution seeks to retrospectively graft
        the theory of recoupment through credit notes onto a meeting where
        no such discussion has been spoken to by any participant.

   730.                     Equally significant is the fact that A-9 is not shown to be
        present in any other alleged conspiratorial meeting. The prosecution
        has also not relied upon tower-location data to place him at the venues
        of other meetings said to be part of the conspiracy. Had such material
        existed, it would ordinarily have found mention in the record. The
        selective invocation of tower-location evidence, confined only to the
        Gauri Apartment meeting, further weakens the prosecution’s attempt
        to establish continuity or participation of A-9 in the alleged
        conspiracy.

   731.                     The prosecution has additionally relied upon the
        statement of Varun Chaudhary (PW-6) to suggest that a petition
        regarding cartelisation under the DEP-21/22 was filed at the behest of
        A-9. This allegation, however, sits uneasily with the prosecution’s own
        theory of conspiracy, in which A-9 is projected as a conspirator.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 359 of 549
        Admittedly, A-9 neither controlled any retail zone nor was he a
        manufacturer. He is not alleged to be a recipient of any upfront
        payment, nor is his company shown to have any association with any
        of the alleged beneficiary entities. The sole allegation against him
        pertains to issuance of so-called non-manufacturer credit notes,
        quantified by the investigating agency at ₹2.58 crores, an amount that
        appears wholly disproportionate and insignificant when juxtaposed
        against the prosecution’s own allegation of recoupment of ₹100
        crores, and that too spread over the entire period of subsistence of the
        Excise Policy.

   732.                     Viewed cumulatively, the material placed on record does
        not disclose any credible, cogent or consistent basis to establish either
        the presence or the role of A-9 in the alleged meeting at Gauri
        Apartment on 21.05.2021. Nor does it sustain the prosecution’s
        attempt to weave the allegation of issuance of credit notes into the
        broader narrative of criminal conspiracy. Even at the threshold stage
        of framing of charge, the record does not give rise to the degree of
        suspicion required in law and rests instead on conjecture and post-
        facto reconstruction rather than on reliable and consistent material.

        (ii) Cash of ₹34,23,172/- is alleged to have been collected from M/S
        Ace Finance Private Limited in lieu of an equivalent amount of credit
        notes issued by A-9.
   733.                     The allegation is that, as per an understanding and on the
        directions of A-3, A-9 (M/S BSPL) issued credit notes in favour of
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 360 of 549
        M/S Ace Finance Private Limited on 18.04.2022 and 12.05.2022, and
        that, in lieu thereof, a total cash amount of ₹34,23,172/- was collected
        by the approver PW-20 from M/S Ace Finance Private Limited. It is
        further the case of the prosecution that the said amount of ₹34,23,172/-
        was ultimately handed over to A-4.

   734.                     As per the material placed on record (D-185), it emerges
        that a total of 36 credit notes are stated to have been issued by A-9
        (M/S BSPL) to M/S Ace Finance Private Limited, which admittedly
        operated two retail zones. However, the ledger (D-183) relied upon by
        the prosecution does not reflect these credit-note transactions in their
        entirety. Consequently, it becomes apparent that the said ledger does
        not depict the complete transactional dealings of M/S Ace Finance
        Private Limited, notwithstanding the fact that the period reflected
        therein spans from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2023.

   735.                      In this backdrop, a foundational question arises as to
        whether such selective ledger entries can be treated as admissible or
        reliable under Section 34 of the Indian Evidence Act. In this context,
        it is material to note that what has been produced is an Excel-sheet
        printout in the form of a ledger containing selective entries, and not
        the complete books of account maintained in the ordinary course of
        business. The Supreme Court has authoritatively held that loose sheets
        or selective extracts, divorced from an integrated and regularly
        maintained system of accounts, do not qualify as “books of account”

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 361 of 549
        within the meaning of Section 34 (Central Bureau of Investigation v.
        V.C. Shukla (1998) 3 SCC 410).

   736.                     This infirmity is further aggravated by the fact that no
        corresponding bank account entries evidencing withdrawal of the
        alleged cash amounts have been relied upon by the prosecution, nor
        has the voucher book or primary vouchers underlying the ledger
        entries been produced. It is well settled that entries in books of
        account, even when regularly kept, are at best corroborative and
        cannot, by themselves, fasten liability. The absence of such primary
        and corroborative material materially diminishes the evidentiary value
        of the ledger entries, which are, in any event, secondary records.

   737.                     The aforesaid deficiencies are further compounded and
        travel to the threshold of inadmissibility by the fact that PW-106 has
        categorically stated that his company stands closed and, further, that
        no certificate under Section 65-B of the Indian Evidence Act has been
        filed. Additionally, neither the electronic device nor the accounting
        system from which the ledger was generated has been seized. In the
        absence of compliance with Section 65-B, electronic records lack
        admissibility (Anvar P.V. v. P.K. Basheer, (2014) 10 SCC 473 and
        Vinubhai Haribhai Malaviya vs. State of Gujrat (2019) 17 SCC1).

   738.                     The Special Expenses Ledger (D-184) reflects two
        entries of cash payments of ₹25 lakhs each, dated 27.12.2021 and
        16.05.2022, allegedly made to PW-20 (the approver). Significantly,
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 362 of 549
        these two entries have not been associated by the prosecution with any
        alleged recoupment conspiracy. This Court also finds that no
        corresponding bank withdrawal entries, withdrawal slips, or cash-
        withdrawal instruments have been brought on record to establish the
        source or even the existence of such cash.

   739.                     Equally significant is the fact that PW-20 himself has
        not stated the receipt of cash amounting to ₹34,55,912/- either in his
        confessional statement recorded under Section 164 of CrPC (pre-
        pardon) or in his statement recorded under Section 306(4) of CrPC
        (post-pardon). This alleged transaction finds mention for the first time
        only in a supplementary statement recorded under Section 161 of
        CrPC on 05.04.2023.

   740.                     It is also well settled that ledger entries, even if assumed
        to be genuine, do not constitute substantive or independent evidence
        and can be used only for corroboration. Moreover, the version of
        PW-20 has to be treated merely as approver statement, it would still
        require independent corroboration on material particulars, in
        accordance with settled law, which is conspicuously absent. Reliance
        is again placed upon the judgments of Hon’ble Supreme Court in K.
        Hashim (supra), Somasundaram (supra), Laxmipat Choraria (supra)
        and A.R. Antulay (supra), (Laxmipat Choraria (supra); R.
        Dineshkumar @ Deena (supra).



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                            Page no. 363 of 549
   741.                     In an attempt to supply such corroboration, the
        prosecution relies upon the statements of PW-1 and PW-106.
        However, on a careful examination of their statements, it becomes
        evident that PW-1 and PW-106 cannot be treated as independent
        witnesses, as their statements disclose circumstances suggestive of
        intentional participation or facilitation in the alleged acts. Their
        evidence, therefore, attracts the settled rule of prudence applicable to
        accomplice-like witnesses and cannot furnish the independent
        corroboration required in law.

   742.                     At this juncture, an additional circumstance arises which
        further undermines the prosecution case and remains wholly
        unexplained. If M/S Ace Finance Private Limited was not a participant
        in the alleged conspiracy, no plausible explanation is forthcoming as
        to why it would agree to release cash merely upon receipt of credit
        notes. This aspect assumes significance in light of the statement of
        PW-2 (Sikander Maan), who is stated to be associated with ADS
        Spirits and is the uncle of PW-1 (Virat Mann), and who has stated that
        the cash amount was released by PW-106, the owner of M/S Ace
        Finance Private Limited, at his request.

   743.                     PW-2 has stated that his relationship with A-4 had
        become strained on account of A-4 having removed the staff provided
        by him, which he has described in the following words:



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 364 of 549
                “Mera karya in logon ke sath theek raha lekin February 2022
                main Abhishek Boinpally ne mere saare aadmiyon ko apni
                sharan ke dukaanon se hatha diya aur meri koi bhi madad karne
                se mana kar dia aur phone uthana band kar dia.”
   744.                     In the face of such admitted strain in relations with A-4,
        the prosecution has offered no explanation as to why Virat Mann
        would nonetheless facilitate or assist the approver PW-20, who is
        projected to be acting on behalf of A-4. This aspect renders the
        prosecution version inherently improbable and remains unaccounted
        for on the material placed on record.

   745.               The ledger entries themselves record narrations such as:

        • “18.04.2022 – Being cash sent to Hauz Khas, approved by Virat
        Sir”

        • “12.05.2022 – Being cash paid to Harjinder Ji (Brindco)”

   746.                     Notably, neither of these entries names PW-20 (Dinesh
        Arora) or Vijay Nair (A-3), against whom the principal allegations are
        sought to be levelled. This omission assumes significance, particularly
        when contrasted with the Special Expenses Ledger, where PW-20 is
        expressly referred to by the code name “Mango”. The absence of any
        reference to PW-20 or A-3 (Vijay Nair) in the impugned entries
        materially weakens the prosecution’s attempt to link these ledger
        notations to the accused persons.




CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 365 of 549
   747.                     It is also pertinent to observe that it is not the
        prosecution’s case that M/S BSPL itself received the cash amounts.
        Had that been so, one would reasonably expect the ledger entries to be
        supported by corresponding bank credits, acknowledgments, or
        voucher-level documentation, none of which have been relied upon.
        On the contrary, the entries placed on record do not support such a
        theory. While some witnesses have suggested that the cash payment
        entries ought to have been made after receipt of rebate, particularly
        with reference to the entry dated 12.05.2022, such assertions rest
        solely on interpretation of the ledger entries, and not on any
        independent banking, voucher, or contemporaneous documentary
        evidence.

   748.                     Viewed cumulatively, the material relied upon by the
        prosecution, being selective ledger extracts, unsupported by
        corresponding bank withdrawal entries, voucher books, primary
        vouchers, electronic certification, or consistent independent oral
        statement, falls short of the legal threshold required even at the stage
        of charge and does not, by itself, give rise to a grave or legally
        sustainable suspicion against the accused.

        Issuance of Credit Notes

   749.                     Under the DEP-21/22, the wholesale and retail liquor
        trade stood fully privatised. In such a market structure, the issuance of


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 366 of 549
        credit notes by manufacturers to retailers, routed through wholesalers,
        formed part of ordinary commercial practice. Owing to fixed margins
        and high operating costs, manufacturers issued credit notes to support
        sales or to adjust earlier transactions. The wholesaler acted only as a
        conduit in the supply chain and exercised no independent discretion in
        this regard. A credit note did not involve any payment of cash and
        operated solely as an accounting adjustment against future supplies.

   750.                     It is an admitted position that the issuance of credit notes
        was not per se illegal and did not violate the DEP-21/22. Viewed in
        this background, the allegation that credit notes were issued to the so-
        called “South Group” as a mode of recoupment requires careful
        scrutiny and must rest on clear and independent evidence, and not on
        inferences drawn merely from a lawful commercial practice.

        Issuance of Credit Notes by UBL to Certain Entities for Alleged
        Adjustment of Amounts Kept for the South Group by A-9

   751.                     The material relied upon by the prosecution in relation
        to the issuance of credit notes by the manufacturer, United Breweries
        Limited (UBL), indicates that credit notes aggregating to ₹14.78
        crores (D-130) were issued to the wholesaler for onward adjustment at
        the retail level. The prosecution does not dispute the issuance of these
        credit notes in their entirety; its objection is confined to a sum of ₹2.78
        crores, which is alleged to have been passed on during November 2022
        and February-March 2023 to certain retailers, namely M/S JSN
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                            Page no. 367 of 549
        Infratech, M/S Samaria Technologies Pvt. Ltd., M/S Grow Tradex and
        M/S Adharv Enterprises, against the sale of beer. The allegation
        proceeds on the premise that the said amount represented an
        adjustment of sums allegedly meant for certain retailers after
        registration of the case.

   752.                     It is also relevant that the DEP-21/22 came into force on
        17.11.2021 and remained operative only for a limited period, before
        being withdrawn and replaced after 31.08.2022. The abrupt
        withdrawal of the policy created a situation that was not contemplated
        by the manufacturer, the wholesaler or the retailers at the time when
        their commercial arrangements were structured. The liquor trade
        operates on a daily basis, involving continuous movement of stock and
        a constant need to meet demand and supply. In such circumstances,
        post-withdrawal accounting adjustments, including reconciliation of
        credits and incentives earned on the basis of prior sales, cannot be
        treated as simple or mechanical exercises.

   753.                     The manner in which the allegation is framed is also of
        relevance. The disputed credit notes are not projected as part of the
        original conspiracy but are sought to be characterised as a subsequent
        act, allegedly undertaken after registration of the case, either to
        conceal earlier transactions or to avoid criminal liability. Even if taken
        at face value, such an allegation attributes the conduct to a post-



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 368 of 549
        registration stage and does not, by itself, disclose a prior meeting of
        minds or a continuing conspiratorial arrangement.

   754.                     It is further of significance that the quantum of the
        disputed amount is, by itself, wholly disproportionate to the allegation
        of recoupment of ₹100 crores. Even assuming the prosecution case at
        its highest, no material has been placed on record to show that the said
        amount was earmarked, reserved or intended for the so-called South
        Group. There is no documentary trail, instruction or supporting
        material connecting the impugned credit notes with any such alleged
        beneficiary. At the highest, even if the prosecution version is stretched
        to its outer limits, the allegation would amount to a commercial or
        contractual dispute between private parties rather than the commission
        of a criminal offence.

   755.                     The prosecution further proceeds on the assumption that
        the manufacturer approved or issued credit notes merely at the instance
        of the wholesaler. The record, however, indicates that the credit notes
        were issued by the manufacturer pursuant to declared schemes linked
        to volume of sales. The liquor trade under the DEP-21/22 was
        regulated, with lifting, sales and payments being subject to
        contemporaneous data and regulatory oversight, shared among the
        relevant stakeholders. The issuance of credit notes thus remained
        linked to recorded sales performance and is not shown to be capable
        of unilateral manipulation by the wholesaler.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 369 of 549
   756.                     It is also material that the manufacturer has not disputed
        the issuance of the impugned credit notes and has stated that they were
        issued strictly in accordance with its sales-based schemes. No material
        has been placed on record to suggest that these credit notes were issued
        dehors the declared scheme or in deviation from actual sales data.

   757.                     The   considered cumulatively material does not rise
        above conjecture and, at best, falls short of even raising a reasonable
        suspicion, far less the grave suspicion required in law to justify the
        framing of charge.

        Outcome after Evaluation

        Failure of the Prosecution’s Conspiracy Theory qua A-9

   758.                     The prosecution seeks to project the existence of a wider
        criminal conspiracy involving public servants, certain private
        individuals described as the “South Group”, and selected business
        entities, with the alleged object of influencing policy formulation,
        securing favourable licensing outcomes, and generating illegal
        gratification through upfront payments and commercial arrangements.
        The sustainability of such a charge necessarily depends upon the
        establishment of a prima facie meeting of minds, a discernible role
        attributed to each accused, and an identifiable unlawful gain flowing
        from the alleged conspiracy.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 370 of 549
   759.                     Even in relation to M/S Indospirit, the prosecution
        attempts to construct a chain of circumstances by referring to the grant
        of the L-1 licence, the allegation of payment of ₹30 lakhs (upfront
        amount) as illegal gratification, the cartelisation complaint involving
        M/S KGRL attributed to A-7, the participation of A-5 and PW-275
        (Prem R. Manduri) as partners allegedly representing the “South
        Group”, the projected involvement of A-4, and the allegation that
        A-3 exerted pressure upon M/S PRI to appoint M/S Indospirit as its
        distributor.

   760.                     No such narrative, however, exists qua M/S BPSL or
        A-9. The prosecution has not alleged that A-9 played any role in policy
        formulation, influenced any public servant, facilitated the grant of any
        licence, participated in cartelisation, or exercised pressure upon any
        manufacturer or distributor. More importantly, there is a complete
        absence of any allegation or material suggesting any interaction, direct
        or indirect, between A-9 and any member of the so-called “South
        Group” in relation to coordination, financial dealing, or concerted
        action between A-9 and those who are alleged to have made upfront
        payments.

   761.                     At the stage of framing of charge, the court is required to
        assess whether the material on record gives rise to grave suspicion.
        Such suspicion cannot rest on conjecture or association by proximity.
        It must be founded on material indicating a meeting of minds and a

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 371 of 549
        role played in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy. Equally material
        is the requirement to show what unlawful gain or advantage A-9 stood
        to derive from the alleged arrangement. In the present case, the
        prosecution has failed to indicate what benefit, commercial, monetary,
        or otherwise, could have accrued to A-9 or M/S BPSL from the alleged
        conspiracy. There is no allegation of payment of bribe by A-9, no
        allegation of receipt of illegal gratification, and no assertion of any
        quid pro quo involving public servants.

                                                               (emphasis supplied)

   762.                     The case against A-9 rests primarily on vague references
        to an “arrangement” attributed to the approver, whether PW-20 or
        PW-226, without particulars, contemporaneous documentation, or
        independent corroboration. Such unparticularised assertions, standing
        alone, are insufficient in law to establish even a prima facie meeting
        of minds.

   763.                     This conclusion is reinforced by admitted and objective
        circumstances. There is no admissible material to suggest that A-9
        attended any meeting at Gauri Apartment. The spot identification
        memo dated 01.10.2022 (D-95) does not record his presence at the
        said location. It is undisputed that A-9 was not present at the alleged
        meeting at ITC Kohinoor, Hyderabad. Thus, the prosecution’s own
        material excludes A-9 from the meetings which are projected as
        pivotal to the alleged conspiracy.
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 372 of 549
   764.                     Further, the prosecution relies upon the filing of a
        petition before the Hon’ble Supreme Court by Advocate Varun
        Chaudhary (PW-6), allegedly at the behest of A-9, challenging
        cartelisation and monopoly under the DEP-21/22. Such conduct is
        fundamentally inconsistent with the prosecution’s theory of
        conspiratorial alignment. A person who is part of a conspiracy to
        cartelise or monopolise a policy framework would not ordinarily
        sponsor or support proceedings before the highest constitutional court
        alleging cartelisation and monopoly under that very policy. This
        circumstance militates against the existence of any shared intent or
        common design.

   765.                     On   a   cumulative   assessment,   the   prosecution’s
        conspiracy theory does not sustain itself insofar as A-9 is concerned.
        The absence of interaction with the “South Group”, the lack of any
        attributed role in policy manipulation or licensing, the failure to
        demonstrate any unlawful gain, and the exclusion of A-9 from alleged
        conspiratorial meetings, render the allegation speculative. In this
        backdrop, any alleged deficiency relating to the issuance of credit
        notes cannot be examined in isolation. Such allegations must be
        assessed in the context of the prosecution’s failure to establish a
        meeting of minds or motive-linked gain, both of which are essential to
        meet the threshold of grave suspicion at the stage of charge.

        Allegation against A-10

   766.                     As per the case set up by the prosecution, A-10, Arjun
        Pandey, is alleged to have functioned as a close associate and operative
        of accused Vijay Nair (A-3) and to have played an active role in the
        alleged criminal conspiracy connected with the formulation and
        implementation of the DEP-21/22. It is alleged that he, along with A-3,
        met the Secretary General of ISWAI and raised demands for undue
        gratification from liquor manufacturers on the assurance that
        favourable provisions would be incorporated in the Excise Policy. The
        prosecution further alleges that he participated in meetings held at
        Gauri Apartments, New Delhi on 21.05.2021 and thereafter at ITC
        Kohinoor, Hyderabad on 19.06.2021, where the modalities of benefit-
        sharing and recovery of alleged upfront payments were discussed.

   767.                     It is further the prosecution’s case that, during the
        relevant period, A-10 was working as President (Sales and Marketing)
        of India Ahead News, and that India Ahead News received an amount
        of ₹1 crore from M/S Indospirits, while APPL received ₹85 lakhs,
        purportedly as part of the alleged recoupment of bribe amounts under
        the guise of media-related transactions. It is alleged that India Ahead
        News, in turn, paid a sum of ₹85 lakhs to A-10 as consultancy charges.
        The prosecution also attributes to him the role of facilitating additional
        credit notes of approximately ₹1 crore for retail zones allegedly
        controlled by Raghav Reddy through accused A-9 (Amandeep Singh

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 374 of 549
        Dhall), and alleges that he remained in constant touch with accused
        A-15 (Arvind Kumar Singh) at the time when funds were allegedly
        being routed to Goa.

   768.                     It is further alleged that A-10 was in contact with Ashok
        Kaushik (PW-195), the personal assistant of K. Kavitha, who is stated
        to have been involved in the transfer of alleged upfront money to Goa
        through Vinod Chauhan via hawala channels. On the basis of the
        aforesaid allegations, the prosecution seeks to portray A-10, as a
        facilitator forming a link between the alleged policy-level decisions,
        media entities, and the purported financial flows said to constitute the
        criminal conspiracy.

        Analysis

        (ii) Presence of A-10 in the meeting at Gauri Apartment

   769.                     It is not in dispute that during the period relevant to the
        alleged conspiracy relating to the formulation and implementation of
        the DEP-21/22, A-10 was working as the Sales and Marketing Head
        of India Ahead News Channel. His professional engagement, as borne
        out from the record, was thus confined to the media domain and did
        not, even remotely, place him within the policy-making or policy-
        implementing framework of the Excise Department.

   770.                     The prosecution seeks to draw an adverse inference
        against A-10 primarily on the basis of his alleged presence in two

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 375 of 549
        meetings, one at Gauri Apartments and another at Hotel Taj Palace,
        New Delhi. However, the prosecution’s own evidence materially
        weakens this assertion. PW-1, who admittedly attended the meeting at
        Gauri Apartments, has categorically stated that although A-10 was
        present, he remained silent throughout and did not participate in the
        discussion. PW-1 and PW-2, who were also present, have consistently
        deposed that the meeting was confined to seeking manpower
        assistance, as certain private parties intended to apply for multiple
        retail zones as already discussed in detail. A careful reading of their
        statements does not disclose any discussion pertaining to manipulation
        or tweaking of the Excise Policy, involvement of public servants, or
        payment of any alleged upfront money. From the statement of the
        prosecution’s own witnesses, nothing incriminating emerges against
        A-10 beyond his mere presence, which, in law, cannot be elevated to
        culpable participation.

   771.                     With regard to the alleged meeting at Hotel Taj Palace,
        the prosecution relies solely on the presence of A-10 alongside Vijay
        Nair. The witness (PW-101) who has spoken of an alleged demand of
        bribe has not attributed any role to A-10; the allegation, such as it is,
        is specifically directed against A-3. As already discussed in this order,
        even that allegation does not find consistent support from the
        prosecution witnesses themselves. In any event, mere presence at a
        meeting, without any material showing participation before or after

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 376 of 549
        the meeting or any conduct in furtherance of the alleged discussion,
        cannot be construed as aiding or abetting a conspiracy. This assumes
        added significance in light of the admitted position that A-10 neither
        directly nor indirectly applied for any wholesaler (L-1) or retail (L-7Z)
        licence under the DEP-21/22, and that IANPL likewise did not submit
        any application for such licences in respect of the works undertaken
        by him.

   772.                     The investigating agency has next attempted to link
        A-10 by referring to payments of ₹1 crore and ₹70 lakhs made by M/S
        Indospirits to APPL and IANPL The allegation has already been
        discussed. However, even at the cost of repetition it is being discussed
        to give it completion. The prosecution does not dispute that India
        Ahead was engaged in media-related activities, nor does it dispute that
        M/S Indospirits had proposed to engage the channel for
        advertisements. The transaction is sought to be characterised as sham
        merely because the amount was paid in advance and the
        advertisements were allegedly not carried out in the same manner as
        with other clients. This contention does not withstand scrutiny. The
        concept paper (D-89) itself reflects that M/S Indospirits was exploring
        engagement with India Ahead. Advance payment, by itself, is a
        common commercial practice and cannot, without anything further,
        render a transaction fictitious or colourable. Significantly, the
        aggregate amount of ₹1.7 crores is wholly inconsequential when

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                     Page no. 377 of 549
        contrasted with the prosecution’s own allegation of illegal gratification
        running into ₹90–100 crores, thereby further eroding the suggested
        inference. If routine banking transactions are to be treated as
        incriminating circumstances, every commercial counter-party of an
        accused company would stand exposed to prosecution, a proposition
        plainly inconsistent with settled principles of criminal law. It also
        bears reiteration that even the person alleged to be controlling IANPL
        has been found to have no substantive role in the alleged conspiracy.

   773.                     The prosecution has further sought to implicate A-10 in
        the alleged movement of cash through angadias for the Goa elections,
        resting primarily on Call Detail Records showing telephonic contact
        with A-15. It is an admitted position that A-15 was working with India
        Ahead News Channel. Mere telephonic connectivity between two
        persons working in the same organisation, without any supporting
        material, cannot establish participation in the movement of funds. This
        Court also cannot ignore the inconsistency in the investigative
        approach: where CDRs exist, they are pressed into service; where they
        do not, the prosecution conveniently suggests communication through
        web-based calls. In the absence of any transcript, content, such
        material, in isolation, is incapable of sustaining any incriminating
        inference. Serious criminal liability cannot be founded on conjecture
        drawn from bare call records.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 378 of 549
   774.                     Finally, finding nothing of substance, the investigating
        agency has sought to raise suspicion on the ground that A-10 was
        drawing a salary of ₹5 lakhs per month, which is portrayed as
        exorbitant and therefore suggestive of involvement in the alleged
        conspiracy. This Court finds no basis for such an assumption. A-10
        was admittedly holding a senior position as President/Sales and
        Marketing Head of a news channel, and no material has been placed
        on record to demonstrate that the said remuneration was either
        abnormal for such a role or indicative of any illicit consideration.

                                                               (emphasis supplied)

   775.                     Taken individually or cumulatively, the circumstances
        relied upon by the prosecution, namely, the admitted silence of A-10
        in the meeting at Gauri Apartments, the absence of any role attributed
        to him in the alleged demand of bribe, the commercial advance paid
        by M/S Indospirits to IANPL, the bare CDRs reflecting contact with a
        co-employee without any transcript or corroboration, and the
        allegation of a “high” salary, do not give rise to grave suspicion. On
        the contrary, they reveal that in the absence of any incriminating
        material, the prosecution has attempted to stitch together innocuous
        and disconnected facts in a bid to implicate A-10, an approach that
        falls short of the threshold required even at the stage of framing of
        charge.

        Allegation against A-11

   776.                     It is the case of the prosecution that A-11, Butchibabu
        Gorantla, was an active participant in the alleged conspiracy and a key
        member of the so-called “South Group”, being a close associate and
        Chartered Accountant of A-17 (K. Kavitha). It is alleged that, during
        the period when the draft of the GoM Report was under finalisation in
        March 2021, he made frequent visits to Delhi. The prosecution further
        alleges that certain provisions relating to the Excise Policy were found
        stored in his mobile phone and that such provisions were thereafter
        incorporated verbatim in the GoM Report on the Excise Policy dated
        22.03.2021. It is also alleged that A-11 was present at a meeting held
        at Gauri Apartments, Delhi, on 21.05.2021, being the date on which
        the policy was approved through circulation during the peak Covid
        period, and that he was also present at another meeting held on
        19.06.2021 at ITC Kohinoor, Hyderabad.

   777.                     According to the prosecution, during the period August,
        September 2021, A-11 received an amount of ₹1 crore from A-4
        (Abhishek Boinpally) through A-6 (Mootha Gautam), and that his
        chats reflect the involvement of A-3 (Vijay Nair), A-23 (Sarath
        Reddy), A-17 (K. Kavitha), Magunta Reddy and others. It is also
        alleged that he acted as a mediator in facilitating payment of ₹10
        crores to A-17 (K. Kavitha) by Raghav Magunta. The prosecution
        further alleges that A-11 was instrumental in a transaction involving

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 380 of 549
        ₹14 crores received by A-17 (K. Kavitha), wherein he allegedly
        handled the documentation and directed Madhu Gorla (PW-235) of the
        Aurobindo Group to inflate the value of the land and reflect it at least
        at ₹28 crores on paper, while also suggesting other changes. It is
        alleged that the said transaction was a sham arrangement and was
        devised as a mode for recoupment of money.

        (i) Alleged Presence of A-11 in the Meeting at Gauri Apartment

   778.                     The allegation against A-11 is that he participated in a
        meeting at Gauri Apartment, Delhi on 21.05.2021, where the
        prosecution claims that the alleged conspiracy began to take shape. To
        establish his presence, the prosecution relies upon the statements of
        the approver PW-20, PW-1 and PW-2.

   779.                     A careful and conjoint reading of these statements does
        not, however, support the prosecution narrative. What emerges from
        the statements of PW-20, PW-1 and PW-2 is only that A-4, A-5 and
        A-11 expressed an inclination to participate in the retail liquor
        business in Delhi by seeking to obtain 5 to 10 retail zones. Such an
        expression of intent was neither impermissible nor unlawful.
        Participation in the retail segment under a policy that expressly
        permitted private entry cannot, by itself, be construed as a
        conspiratorial act.




CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 381 of 549
   780.                     It is significant that PW-1 and PW-2, who are cited by
        the prosecution as material witnesses, have themselves been projected
        as innocent participants. No criminality has been attributed to them,
        despite their admitted presence at the said meeting and despite the fact
        that they admittedly provided staff for operating retail zones of A-4. If
        discussions relating to participation in retail zones or the provision of
        manpower were to be viewed as incriminating, the same standard
        would necessarily apply to PW-1 and PW-2. The selective attribution
        of culpability to the accused, while absolving similarly placed
        participants, materially weakens the prosecution case.

   781.                     The record further discloses a prior and close proximity
        between A-1 and A-2 and the approver PW-20, who was admittedly
        referred to by them by the nickname “Mango”. This admitted
        familiarity and association, when contrasted with the attempt to
        portray PW-1 and PW-2 as neutral or uninvolved actors, renders the
        prosecution narrative internally inconsistent.

   782.                     None of the witnesses state that, at the alleged meeting,
        there was any discussion regarding payment of bribes, adoption of
        illegal means, manipulation of policy, or involvement of any public
        servant. The statements consistently indicate that the concern of the
        so-called South Group was limited to operational aspects of entering a
        new market. Being new to the Delhi retail liquor business, they sought
        assistance from persons already engaged in the trade.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 382 of 549
   783.                      This is reflected in the statements themselves, which
        record that PW-1 and PW-2 could assist by providing experienced staff
        to operate retail vends. Such discussions are squarely within the realm
        of ordinary commercial arrangements.

   784.                     The discussion regarding taking 5 to 10 retail zones also
        cannot be characterised as criminal in nature. The allotment of retail
        zones was through a public auction process, the outcome of which was
        uncertain and dependent upon competitive bidding. There could be no
        assurance or certainty of securing any particular number of zones at
        the stage of a preliminary discussion. Notably, the prosecution has not
        alleged any manipulation, rigging or undue influence in the auction or
        allotment process. In the absence of such allegations, a mere intention
        to participate in the auction does not give rise to any inference of
        illegality.

   785.                     Even at the cost of repetition, it is stated that PW-1 has
        clearly stated that A-11 was making enquiries regarding the financial
        aspects of the Delhi liquor market. PW-1 states: “Sh Butchi Babu was
        mainly asking the questions about financial aspects of the business
        that how is the Delhi market , how we can make profits .”

   786.                     When this deposition is read alongside the prosecution
        narrative, an evident inconsistency emerges. The record indicates that
        even in May 2021, A-11 was seeking to understand the profitability,
        operational contours and commercial feasibility of the Delhi market.
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 383 of 549
        At the same time, the prosecution asserts that by March 2021 a part of
        the alleged “upfront money” had already been delivered pursuant to a
        concluded arrangement.

   787.                     If that version were to be accepted, the alleged demand
        and its partial execution would have already stood crystallised.
        However, the material attributed to A-11 reflects that basic commercial
        issues, such as staffing of retail operations, setting up of shops and
        overall market viability, were still being explored. Such conduct does
        not align with the existence of a settled and pre-determined criminal
        conspiracy.

   788.                     The later portion of the statement of PW-2 further
        undermines the prosecution case. PW-2, who was admittedly
        associated with ADS Spirits and was engaged in the manufacture of
        the “Royal Green” brand of whisky, does not speak of any continuing
        interaction with the South Group. On the contrary, he states that his
        relations with A-4 became strained in February 2022 after the staff
        provided by him were removed, and that thereafter A-4 stopped
        responding to his calls. This disclosure indicates a breakdown of
        commercial association rather than the continuation of any concerted
        or conspiratorial arrangement.

   789.                     Crucially, there is a complete absence of material to
        suggest that, at the alleged meeting of 21.05.2021, there was any
        discussion concerning formulation or implementation of the Excise
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 384 of 549
        Policy, fixation of wholesale margins, grant of licences, or any other
        regulatory or policy matter. Even if the prosecution material is taken
        at its highest, it does not disclose any deliberation touching upon abuse
        of official position or involvement of public servants.

   790.                     Viewed in this backdrop, the allegation that the meeting
        at Gauri Apartment marked the genesis of a criminal conspiracy
        involving A-11 is wholly unsupported by the record. The material
        relied upon by the prosecution reflects, at best, preliminary and lawful
        commercial discussions, devoid of any illegal objective or meeting of
        minds to commit an offence.

        (ii) Alleged Bank Transfers from A-6 to A-11 Projected as a Money
        Trail Originating from M/S Indospirit

        Analysis

   791.                     The prosecution alleges that amounts of ₹25 lakhs on
        02.08.2021, ₹20 lakhs on 07.08.2021, ₹15 lakhs on 24.08.2021 and
        ₹40 lakhs on 27.09.2021 were transferred from the bank account of
        A-6 to the account of A-11. On this basis, an attempt is made to project
        a money trail allegedly emanating from M/S Indospirit, with a further
        insinuation that A-7 was instrumental in facilitating or routing such
        funds.

   792.                     This Court is unable to discern how the said
        transactions, by themselves, can be connected to the alleged

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 385 of 549
        conspiracy. As per the prosecution’s own narrative, the alleged upfront
        amount paid by the so-called South Group was to be recouped from
        future earnings generated under the DEP-21/22 through an enhanced
        wholesale margin of 12%, out of which 6% was allegedly meant for
        recoupment. Such recoupment, even on the prosecution’s case, was
        contingent upon the commencement of retail operations. Admittedly,
        retail vends commenced only on 17.11.2021.

   793.                     The transactions relied upon by the prosecution pertain
        to the period August and September 2021, a stage prior to the
        commencement of retail operations and prior to any possibility of
        revenue generation under the new policy framework. These transfers,
        therefore, cannot be reconciled with the prosecution’s own theory of
        recoupment. Rather than lending support to the allegation of
        conspiracy, the timing of these transactions negates the very
        foundation of the prosecution case on this aspect.

                                                             (emphasis supplied)

   794.                     The material placed on record, at best, indicates that
        certain financial transactions took place between accused persons.
        However, the investigating agency cannot be permitted to ascribe a
        conspiratorial colour to every such transaction in the absence of a
        demonstrable nexus with the alleged object or mechanism of the
        conspiracy. Criminal liability cannot be inferred merely on the basis


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 386 of 549
        of financial dealings, unless such dealings are shown to be intrinsically
        connected with the alleged offence.
                                                               (emphasis supplied)

   795.                     Viewed in this light, the transactions relied upon by the
        prosecution do not advance its case in any manner. On the contrary,
        they undermine the prosecution’s own theory and fail to disclose any
        prima facie linkage with the alleged conspiracy. Even at the threshold
        stage, the material falls short of raising a grave suspicion so as to
        justify the framing of charge on this count.

        (iii) Allegation of A-11 Acting as a Conduit for A-17 and Alleged
        Coordination of ₹10 Crore Delivery (March 2021)

   796.                     The prosecution alleges that A-11 acted as a conduit for
        A-17 and coordinated the delivery of a sum of ₹10 crores in March
        2021. It is alleged that A-11 approached the approver (PW-226) to
        persuade him to arrange an upfront payment of ₹50 crores for entry
        into the Delhi liquor business.

   797.                     In the main charge-sheet, the prosecution projected the
        meeting at Gauri Apartment as the starting point of the alleged
        conspiracy. Subsequently, upon the introduction of PW-226 as an
        approver, the alleged genesis of the conspiracy has been shifted to a
        period prior thereto. This change is not merely temporal but strikes at
        the consistency of the prosecution narrative, as the alleged


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 387 of 549
        commencement              of   the   conspiracy   is   altered   without        any
        contemporaneous documentary or independent evidentiary basis.

   798.                     As per the revised version, PW-226 allegedly agreed to
        make an upfront payment of ₹25 crores, out of which a part payment
        of ₹10 crores is stated to have been made in March 2021 at the instance
        of A-11. The prosecution claims that the said amount was delivered
        through PW-227, who was working as a personal assistant to
        PW-226.

   799.                     It is a settled principle that the statement of an approver
        cannot be relied upon unless it is independently corroborated on
        material particulars. Corroboration must come from a source which is
        reliable and independent; repetition of the approver’s version by
        persons who are themselves participants in the alleged transaction
        does not satisfy this requirement.

   800.                     The prosecution seeks to rely upon PW-225, PW-226
        and PW-227. PW-225 is admittedly projected as a participant in the
        alleged conspiracy, though examined as a prosecution witness. His
        statement, therefore, is to be treated as that of an accomplice-like
        witness. In law, an accomplice cannot corroborate the statement of an
        approver; both require independent corroboration from a source
        untainted by participation or interest.




CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 388 of 549
   801.                     This leaves PW-227 as the only witness sought to be
        projected as an independent link. However, his statement does not
        withstand scrutiny. PW-227 claims to have delivered the alleged
        amount but is unable to state the mobile number which was allegedly
        provided by A-11 for the purpose of delivery. He does not disclose the
        name of the person to whom the amount was delivered, nor does he
        specify the exact flat or premises where the delivery allegedly took
        place. This omission is significant, particularly when PW-227 states
        that he has been residing in Chennai for about 25 years and had
        allegedly visited the place of delivery on two occasions.

   802.                     Further, while the investigating agency has relied upon
        tower-location data to suggest meetings at places such as the Oberoi
        Hotel and Gauri Apartment no corresponding tower-location or digital
        evidence has been produced to support the allegation of delivery of
        ₹10 crores. The selective reliance on technical evidence, coupled with
        the absence of similar material for the alleged delivery, leaves a clear
        evidentiary void.

   803.                     It is also relevant that PW-227 has been associated with
        the Magunta family for over two decades. His long-standing
        association renders his statement derivative in nature and closely
        aligned with the version of the approver. His statement does not
        corroborate the approver on any material particular such as the identity



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 389 of 549
        of the recipient, the exact place of delivery, or any contemporaneous
        record evidencing movement or handling of such a substantial sum.

   804.                     On a cumulative assessment, the allegation that A-11
        coordinated the delivery of ₹10 crores rests solely on the
        uncorroborated statement of the approver, sought to be supported by
        accomplice-like witnesses and a derivative account lacking material
        particulars. In the absence of independent corroboration, whether
        documentary, digital or circumstantial, the prosecution version
        remains speculative and insufficient to sustain the allegation even at
        the stage of framing of charge. Reliance is again placed upon the
        judgments of Hon’ble Supreme Court in K. Hashim (supra),
        Somasundaram (supra), Laxmipat Choraria (supra) and A.R. Antulay
        (supra).

        (iv) Contextual Evaluation of WhatsApp Chats Dated 06.03.2021 and
        20.03.2021- Policy Manipulation on the threshold of Grave
        Suspicion

   805.                     The prosecution has relied upon these chats to contend
        that on 06.03.2021 there was a plan for “tweaking” the excise policy
        and that the chat dated 20.03.2021 contains material which later found
        place in the final draft report of the GoM. In order to evaluate this
        contention, the entire content must be seen contextually; no isolated
        expression can be read divorced from the surrounding material.


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 390 of 549
   806.                 The record reflects that these were not exchanges with any
        co-accused, public servant or third party. The content was transmitted
        from one device of A-11 to another device operated by him. In
        substance, therefore, the material is in the nature of personal notes or
        self-compiled drafts and not inter se communications evidencing any
        agreement or concert.

   807.                     On a plain reading, the document titled “Excise policy
        Notes” appears exploratory and descriptive rather than prescriptive in
        nature.

   808.                     The note begins with a general observation:

                “At present, Delhi government is trying to reduce the
                Government intervention, minimize the bureaucracy and
                leaving the market to market forces.”
   809.                     This statement does not contain any directive or
        proposal; it merely records a perception regarding the policy direction.
        The subsequent line continues in the same vein: “It means, the
        consumers will be benefited, government revenue will be increased.
        Also its works in favor of the mid and premium segment brands and
        not the cheap liquor.”

   810.                     These are broad commercial inferences drawn from an
        anticipated shift toward market-oriented regulation. They read as
        commentary on the perceived economic impact of a policy framework,
        not as suggestions for altering it.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                            Page no. 391 of 549
   811.                     It is relevant to note that at the material time the Ravi
        Dhawan Report regarding restructuring and privatization of retail
        zones was already in the public domain. Stakeholder meetings and
        deliberations were underway, and media reports had extensively
        covered the proposed shift towards privatization and reduction of
        governmental control. Seen in that backdrop, the observations
        recorded in the note cannot be treated as exclusive, confidential or
        internally sourced inputs. They reflect matters already circulating in
        public discourse. The note then expressly acknowledges uncertainty:

                “In the given scenario, as a liquor manufacturer, distributor or
                end shop owner the exact business opportunity is not known.”
   812.                     This sentence demonstrates that the author did not claim
        knowledge of any finalised structure or assured commercial benefit.
        On the contrary, it records lack of clarity regarding business
        opportunity across the spectrum, manufacturer, distributor or retailer.

   813.           The next line states:

                “In this regard, we have appointed a consultant who will give
                us the policy tweaking and give us the ins and outs of the policy
                required and presentable business opportunity.”
   814.                     When read in context with the preceding sentence, the
        expression “policy tweaking” cannot be isolated. The sentence, taken
        as a whole, reflects an attempt to understand the “ins and outs of the
        policy” and to evaluate a “presentable business opportunity.” It
        conveys commercial due diligence rather than authorship or alteration

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 392 of 549
        of governmental policy. The reference to appointing a consultant
        indicates that professional assistance was sought to understand the
        contours of the policy and its business implications.

   815.                     The note further records:

                “From that view we are required make 2/3 delhi visits, detailed
                discussions, freezing the policy etc., then we know the final
                business opportunity”
   816.                     This indicates that even at that stage, the policy was not
        considered final from a commercial standpoint and required
        clarification through visits and discussions. The language suggests
        assessment and understanding, not intervention.

   817.                      The concluding portion reads:

                “However, sure short business opportunity is logistics
                management and security label printing and other security
                contracts. We are required to know the eligibilities norms”
   818.                     This   identifies   ancillary   commercial   possibilities,
        logistics management, security label printing, security contracts, and
        the need to understand eligibility norms. These are operational and
        compliance-oriented aspects. They do not relate to drafting clauses,
        determining margins, restructuring statutory provisions, or influencing
        governmental authorities.

   819.                     Another message sent shortly thereafter on 06.03.2021
        seeks information regarding the number of shops, value and volume,
        number of cases category-wise, present fees and rate structure, shops

        timings of bars, number of dry days, profits to end shop owners for the
        last three years, slab variations, brand launching formalities, and
        comparable data for Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab. The tenor of
        this message demonstrates a request for basic regulatory and statistical
        particulars. It indicates absence of familiarity with the framework and
        an attempt to gather data before assessing feasibility. The reference
        to “2/3 Delhi visits” and “detailed discussions” likewise suggests that
        further understanding was required before arriving at any conclusion
        regarding business opportunity.

   820.                     Taken together, the chats dated 06.03.2021 show: (i)
        lack of clarity regarding the business opportunity; (ii) appointment of
        a consultant for understanding the policy framework; (iii) collection
        of regulatory and statistical data of the adjoining States like Utter
        Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab and (iv) preliminary assessment of
        logistics and compliance issues. There is nothing in these messages to
        indicate         participation   in   drafting,   shaping,   or     influencing
        governmental policy. No communication is addressed to any public
        authority. No financial clause, margin structure, or revenue design is
        discussed.

   821.                 The chats dated 20.03.2021 are similarly in the form of
        internal notes. One of them is captioned:

        advert to enhancement of wholesale margin, financial structuring, or
        any revenue design.

   823.                     The second message dated 20.03.2021, under the
        heading “Elite stores,” reads: “Elite stores

        premium store)
        3. elite stores can not be operated by a distributor or a manufacturer
        4. minimum turnover for a store owner should be Rs 50 crores (from
        one store ? per year or the last … 3 years ?)
        5. no pending cases should be there in any Delhi state ? / across
        India”
   824.                  The language is exploratory and interrogative. The figure
        mentioned is “Rs 50 crores,” framed as a query. There is no reference
        to enhancement of wholesale margin from 5% to 12%, nor to any ₹500
        crore turnover stipulation for five years, which the prosecution treats
        as central to the alleged generation of recoupment funds. There is no
        discussion of any financial mechanism or structured benefit.

   825.                     Further, as per the prosecution’s own case, a photocopy
        of the GoM Report had already been handed over which form the basis
        of second draft GoM report dated 19.03.2021 and ultimately became
        the final report. If that chronology is accepted, the report stood
        prepared prior to the chats dated 20.03.2021. The sequence of events
        does not substantiate the contention that these notes had any bearing
        on the recommendations of the GoM, nor does it establish that there
        existed any occasion or necessity for A-11 to record such notes when
        the GoM’s recommendations had already been finalized.

   826.                     When read in their entirety and in light of the fact that
        the Ravi Dhawan Report and stakeholder deliberations were already
        in the public domain, the chats dated 06.03.2021 and 20.03.2021
        reflect exploratory commercial inquiry and internal assessment of
        regulatory structure and eligibility norms. They do not disclose
        participation in governmental deliberations, drafting of policy clauses,
        or any nexus with the financial components forming the basis of the
        prosecution case. Even if taken at face value, the material does not
        disclose the essential ingredients of the alleged conspiracy and does
        not give rise to grave suspicion so as to warrant framing of charge.

        (v) Examination of the Alleged Land Transaction between A-17 and
        A-23 and the Attributed Role of A-11

   827.                     So far as A-11 is concerned, the allegation regarding the
        land transaction is founded essentially on certain communications and
        his position as Chartered Accountant of A-17 (Ms. K. Kavitha).

   828.                     The record indicates that a draft Agreement of Sale
        reflecting a consideration of ₹14 crores was forwarded by A-11 to
        officials of the Aurobindo Group. Thereafter, the Agreement of Sale
        dated 12.07.2021 reflected a total consideration of ₹28 crores, with
        ₹14 crores payable as advance. Reliance is placed by the prosecution
        on a WhatsApp message attributed to A-11 stating, inter alia, “Keep at
        least 28 on paper” and suggesting removal of the interest clause. On


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 397 of 549
        that basis, it is alleged that A-11 played a role in enhancing the
        consideration and structuring the agreement.

   829.                     Thus, qua A-11, the case rests primarily on: (i)
        forwarding of the draft agreement, (ii) the WhatsApp communication
        regarding enhancement of value and deletion of the interest clause,
        and (iii) subsequent messages said to indicate urgency of payment and
        sharing of allotment-related information. These circumstances are
        relied upon to suggest facilitation of the impugned transaction.

   830.                     Admittedly, the land transaction pertains to July 2021.
        The prosecution seeks to portray it as a mode of payment of alleged
        “upfront money” or as recoupment thereof. However, even in the
        conspiracy narrative set out in the charge-sheets, there is no specific
        allegation that recoupment was to be effected through retailers. There
        is no case that recovery of any alleged upfront payment was to be made
        by means of retail transactions.

   831.                     It is also not alleged that A-23 was associated with any
        wholesaler or that he had paid any upfront amount necessitating
        recoupment. The material shows that A-23 participated in bidding for
        retail zones. There is no allegation that he was involved in wholesale
        operations or that he stood to gain through wholesale margins. In the
        absence of such linkage, the premise that a land transaction involving
        him constituted recoupment lacks foundation.


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 398 of 549
   832.                     Though it has been generally alleged that A-23 was
        favoured in securing five retail zones, no material has been produced
        to demonstrate manipulation of the auction process. The allotment of
        retail zones was conducted through an auction mechanism. The
        investigating agency has neither alleged that the bidding process was
        compromised nor that eligibility conditions were violated. In the
        absence of any material indicating interference or procedural breach,
        the allegation of favouritism remains unsubstantiated.

   833.                     It is further an admitted position that the land transaction
        was never fully executed and that the advance amount was returned.
        There was no completed transfer of property. No enduring financial
        benefit arising from the transaction has been demonstrated. In such
        circumstances, characterising the transaction as a conduit for
        recoupment requires clear material establishing such nexus, which is
        not forthcoming.

   834.                     A plain reading of the record shows that the agreement
        to sell the land relates to a period when the alleged recoupment is not
        even stated to have commenced. On the face of it, the land transaction
        does not bear any connection with the Excise Policy. Even if the
        WhatsApp chats are accepted in the manner suggested by the
        prosecution, they do not demonstrate any nexus with the policy; in the
        absence of such linkage, they lose relevance.

   835.                     At this stage, the discussion is confined only to the role
        attributed to A-11. The allegation, insofar as it concerns A-17, shall be
        considered separately and in appropriate detail.

   836.                     A plain reading of the record shows that the agreement

        does not bear any connection with the Excise Policy. Even if the

        attributed to A-11. The allegation, insofar as it concerns A-17, shall be
        considered separately and in appropriate detail.

   838.                     Criminal liability is personal and cannot be inferred
        solely on the basis of association or contemporaneous commercial
        dealings. In the absence of statutory provision, vicarious liability has
        no application in criminal law. Guilt by association is not recognised.
        Suspicion, cannot take the place of legally admissible material prima
        facie showing participation in an unlawful agreement.

   839.                     Viewed thus, the attempt to link the unexecuted land
        transaction with the broader conspiracy narrative rests on inference



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 400 of 549
        rather than demonstrable material connecting A-11 or A-23 with any
        criminal design.

        Allegation against A-17

   840.                     According to the prosecution, A-17, Ms. K. Kavitha,
        occupied a central and facilitative role in the alleged criminal
        conspiracy relating to the formulation and implementation of the Delhi
        DEP-21/22. It is alleged that she acted in concert with members of the
        so-called “South Group” and with accused Vijay Nair (A-3), and that
        she functioned as a political and strategic conduit for select private
        liquor interests seeking favourable policy outcomes. The charge-sheet
        proceeds primarily on approver statements to assert that she was
        associated with the raising, conveyance and facilitation of an alleged
        demand for an “up-front” payment of about ₹100 crore in
        consideration of incorporation of favourable provisions in the policy
        and advantageous outcomes in the tendering and licensing process.
        She is further alleged to have had an indirect beneficial interest in the
        L-1 wholesaler, M/S Indospirits, through associates or proxies, and to
        have received proceeds of illegal gratification camouflaged as
        legitimate transactions, including, a purported land transaction of ₹14
        crore, and a CSR donation routed through an NGO stated to be
        connected to her.

   841.                     In furtherance of this alleged arrangement, accused A-11
        (Butchibabu Gorantla) is stated to have acted as a field-level
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 401 of 549
        coordinator on behalf of the “South Group”, having approached the
        Magunta side to arrange funds and facilitated alleged cash deliveries
        through intermediaries or employees, including purported deliveries at
        Chennai, which are treated by the prosecution as part-payment of the
        alleged illegal gratification. The Magunta side, namely Magunta
        Sreenivasulu Reddy (PW-225) and his son approver Raghav Magunta
        (PW-226), are alleged to have had business interests under the new
        excise regime, including participation in the L-1 wholesaler M/S Indo
        Spirits and acquisition of retail zones, and to have been approached
        with a demand for payment in lieu of favourable policy and business
        outcomes; Raghav Magunta, having been granted pardon under
        Section 306 of Cr.P.C., is relied upon as an approver to support the
        allegation of demand, arrangement and partial payment through
        intermediaries. The prosecution further alleges that persons connected
        with Aurobindo-linked entities (A-23) benefited from allotment of
        retail zones under the policy and formed part of the alleged financial
        arrangements, asserting that funds originating from such entities were
        routed to A-17 through transactions projected as lawful, including the
        aforesaid land deal and other payments, that such entities had advance
        access to information regarding successful bidders, and that even after
        withdrawal of the policy, outstanding dues payable to the L-1
        wholesaler were permitted to remain unpaid as a continuing benefit
        within the alleged conspiracy.

        Analysis

        (i) Land Deal — Alleged Recoupment of “Upfront Money” by A-17

   842.                    The record indicates that a draft Agreement of Sale dated
        12.07.2021 (D-302), reflecting a consideration of ₹14 crores, was
        forwarded by A-11 to officials of the Aurobindo Group. Thereafter, the
        Agreement of Sale dated 12.07.2021 reflected a total consideration of
        ₹28 crores, with ₹14 crores payable as advance. The prosecution relies
        upon this land transaction to contend that it constituted payment of the
        alleged “upfront money” or recoupment thereof. In the Third
        Supplementary Charge-sheet (para 16.40), it is asserted that “the
        investigation has further revealed that the accused Ms. K. Kavitha has
        also recouped the payment of the upfront money by way of obtaining
        Rs 14 crores from the company of Sh. Sarath Chandra Reddy in guise
        of land deal.”

   843.                     When this allegation is examined in the backdrop of the
        prosecution’s own conspiracy narrative, it does not withstand scrutiny.
        The charge-sheets consistently project recoupment as a mechanism
        linked to profits generated at the wholesale level under the L-1 regime.
        The prosecution theory is that a portion of the enhanced margin was
        to be recovered through profit-sharing arrangements within wholesale
        entities, including by induction of members of the so-called South
        Group into the partnership structure of wholesalers such as M/S
        Indospirit. There is neither allegation nor material to show that A-23
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 403 of 549
        had any role, share, control, or association, directly or indirectly, with
        the wholesale layer, whether in M/S Indospirit or in BSPL.

   844.                     It is separately alleged that A-23 was controlling five
        retail zones. Even assuming that allegation at face value, the
        prosecution does not contend that the allotment of those retail zones
        was vitiated by corruption, manipulation, or deviation from policy.
        None of the charge-sheets assail the grant of retail zones as having
        been secured in violation of rules or regulations. More significantly,
        there is no specific allegation in the conspiracy narrative that
        recoupment was to be effected through retailers before they receive
        credit notes. The prosecution case does not suggest that recovery of
        any alleged upfront payment was to be made through retail
        transactions.

   845.                     The inconsistency becomes evident when the allegation
        is tested against commercial logic. If recoupment was to arise from
        wholesale profits, and A-23 had no demonstrated stake in the
        wholesale regime, there was no occasion for him to make any payment
        by way of recoupment. The record does not disclose how or why A-23,
        who is not shown to have derived any share in the wholesale layer,
        would part with ₹14 crores for such purpose.

   846.                     The timeline further weakens the prosecution theory.
        The retail vends, as per the prosecution’s own case, commenced
        operations only in or around November 2021. If recoupment is to be
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 404 of 549
        linked to earnings under the policy, the question arises as to how an
        agreement to sale allegedly made in July 2021, prior to the operational
        phase of the retail regime, could represent recovery of profits not yet
        earned. On the prosecution’s own showing, the alleged recoupment
        precedes the very accrual of any profit stream from which it could
        have been sourced.

   847.                     Even otherwise, reliance is placed upon the statements
        of GTSL Prasad (PW-234) and Madhu Gorla (PW-235). A perusal of
        those statements merely establishes the existence of the agreement to
        sell; they do not attribute any criminal intent or unlawful design to the
        accused. The documentary record further shows that M/S Mahira
        Ventures issued a legal notice dated 30.05.2022 (D-303) seeking
        refund in respect of the land transaction, pointing out non-fulfilment
        of obligations by the seller. Pursuant thereto, the advance
        consideration was returned to the company. The transaction did not
        culminate in sale of the land, and admittedly the payment stood
        refunded.

   848.                     The date of the transaction, coupled with its complete
        misalignment with the pleaded mechanism of conspiracy, indicates
        that it was an independent contractual arrangement having no nexus
        with the Excise Policy. On a cumulative consideration of the material,
        the attempt to treat the land transaction as a vehicle for recoupment is
        not borne out by the prosecution’s own pleaded mechanism, nor by the

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 405 of 549
        timeline, nor by the documentary record. The allegation is internally
        inconsistent and, when tested against the prosecution narrative itself,
        does not support the inference sought to be drawn.

        (ii)      Corporate Social Responsibility (hereinafter referred to as
        “CSR”) Contribution Allegation

   849.                     The prosecution alleges that the CSR contribution of
        ₹80 lakhs made by Aurobindo Pharma Limited to Telangana Jagruthi
        in June 2021 was not a genuine CSR expenditure, but a concealed
        mode of transferring illegal gratification to A-17. Though reflected as
        a CSR payment and routed through banking channels, it is suggested
        that the contribution formed part of the broader conspiracy alleged
        under the Delhi DEP-21/22.

   850.                     On scrutiny of the material relied upon, this allegation
        does not disclose the basic ingredients necessary to sustain such an
        inference. The prosecution has not shown that the payment was
        anything other than a CSR contribution duly recorded in the statutory
        books of the donor company and in the financial records of the
        recipient organisation. The amount was transferred through regular
        banking channels and is supported by disclosed financial
        documentation. There is no allegation of cash movement,
        concealment, falsification of accounts, or diversion for personal
        benefit.

   851.                     It is of significance that the payment was made in June
        2021. The prosecution’s own theory of conspiracy, as examined in
        detail earlier, projects the alleged “recoupment” mechanism as a
        subsequent arrangement, to operate after implementation of the policy
        and upon accrual of profits. The attempt to characterise a June 2021
        CSR contribution as recoupment is inconsistent with that framework.
        A payment made prior to the stage at which recoupment is stated to
        have arisen cannot, in the absence of supporting material, be read into
        that theory.

   852.                     Further, no contemporaneous material has been placed
        on record to indicate that the contribution was made in consideration
        of any public act, licence, policy decision, or official favour. There is
        no allegation of demand, solicitation, or acceptance of an undue
        advantage by A-17 in relation to any public duty. The inference sought
        to be drawn rests merely on an assumed association between the donor
        company and liquor business interests, and between the recipient NGO
        and the accused, without establishing any legally sustainable nexus
        with the exercise of official influence.

   853.                     Even with respect to A-23, the material does not advance
        the prosecution case. He is not shown to have any connection with a
        manufacturer or wholesaler. The only allegation is that he was holding
        five retail zones. The allotment of those retail zones is admittedly not
        under challenge. In the absence of any demonstrated illegality in such

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 407 of 549
        allotment, or any material linking the holding of retail zones with the
        CSR contribution in question, the suggested connection remains
        speculative.

   854.                     On   the   material    presently   available,      the       CSR
        contribution appears as a disclosed and accounted transaction,
        unsupported by evidence of demand, quid pro quo, concealment, or
        misuse. The allegation rests on inference rather than demonstrable
        linkage to any corrupt act. Even at the stage of charge, it does not give
        rise to grave suspicion against A-17. To treat a lawful and documented
        CSR contribution as criminal, without any material of corrupt intent
        or nexus with a public function, would amount to attributing
        culpability by presumption, which is impermissible in law.

        (iii) Allegation of Indirect Equity Interest of A-17 through A-5 in M/S
        Indospirit

   855.                     It is alleged by the prosecution that A-17 held an indirect
        equity interest of 32.5% in M/S Indo Spirits through accused A-5
        (Arun R. Pillai), projected as her proxy, while M/S Indospirit
        Distribution Ltd. of accused A-7 (Sameer Mahendru) held 35%. The
        prosecution alleges that A-5 invested Rs. 3.40 crores in M/S Indospirit
        and that, out of this amount, Rs. 2.90 crores was sourced from
        associates of A-17. In support of this allegation, reliance is placed
        upon the statements recorded under Section 161 of CrPC of PW-242


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                              Page no. 408 of 549
        to PW-245. The individual transactions reflected in the record are as
        follows:

                            (a) Kiran Kumar Luvanath (PW-243) advanced Rs. 50
        lakhs on 16.11.2021, which was returned on 18.03.2022. He stated that
        A-5 was his client and that the loan was given on the basis of personal
        understanding. Although he acknowledged knowing A-17 in a general
        sense, he has nowhere stated that the loan was advanced at her
        instance.

                            (b) Kalpesh Jain (PW-242) advanced Rs. 40 lakhs on
        16.11.2021, repaid on 19.03.2022. He categorically stated that he did
        not know A-17. The amount was provided at the request of Kiran
        Kumar Luvanath and not on any directions of A-17.

                            (c) Shashank Boyenpalli (PW-244) advanced Rs. 1 crore
        on 17.11.2021, returned on 25.08.2022. He had known A-5 since
        2019–2020 and granted the loan at A-5’s request. He expressly stated
        that he did not know A-17 and did not attribute the transaction to her.

                            (d) V. Srinivas Rao (PW-245) advanced Rs. 1 crore on
        16.11.2021, which was returned on 10.12.2021. The prosecution relies
        heavily upon one sentence in his statement wherein he states that he
        granted the loan on the directions of A-17. However, the relevant
        portion must be read in its entirety. PW-245 states: “… on 15.11.2021,
        along with Sh. Arun Pillai, I met at Hotel 36 situated at Road No. 36

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 409 of 549
        in Hyderabad. There, Sh. Arun Pillai requested me to lend Rs. 1
        crore as a short-term loan for around 15 days for business purposes.
        He assured me that he would return the money within 15 days.
        I gave him the money on the directions of Ms. K. Kavitha, MLC. I
        transferred an amount of Rs. 1 crore to Sh. Arun Pillai through RTGS
        from the account of M/S Nirmitee Developers.”

   856.                     The statement itself records that the request for the loan
        originated from A-5. The transfer was effected through RTGS from the
        bank account of a firm to the bank account of A-5. It was not a cash
        transaction. The amount was returned in full within a short period. It
        is not the prosecution’s case that the amount remained unpaid or that
        it was diverted.

   857.                     As regards the remaining three lenders, their statements
        do not indicate that the loans were advanced at the instance of A-17.
        PW-242 does not know A-17. PW-244 has denied knowing her.
        PW-243’s acquaintance is limited to a professional interaction relating
        to interior work. Such limited familiarity cannot reasonably be
        elevated to an inference that substantial loans were advanced at her
        behest, particularly when the witnesses themselves deny any such
        direction.

   858.                     There is also no material placed on record to show that
        the alleged investment of Rs. 2.90 crores was repaid by A-5 out of
        funds supplied by A-17. No corresponding financial trail from A-17 to
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 410 of 549
        A-5 has been demonstrated. Their statements, in fact, run contrary to
        what has been projected by the investigating agency.

   859.                     The position would have been materially different had
        the prosecution been able to demonstrate that A-17 herself provided
        cash or funds which were then routed through intermediary accounts
        and ultimately credited to A-5, or that the investment made by A-5
        resulted in a demonstrable return or benefit to A-17. However, that is
        not the prosecution case. Even if the prosecution version is accepted
        at its highest, that A-17 facilitated introductions or that persons
        acquainted with her extended financial assistance to A-5, such facts,
        by themselves, do not give rise to a legally sustainable inference that
        A-5 was acting as a proxy or benami for A-17.
                                                            (emphasis supplied)

   860.                     Criminal liability cannot be founded on conjectural
        extensions of association or acquaintance. The concept of “proxy” or
        “acting on behalf of” in criminal law requires clear and cogent
        evidence of control, direction, or beneficial ownership. Mere
        facilitation, recommendation, or acquaintance-based financial support
        does not satisfy this threshold. To accept the prosecution’s inference
        would be to collapse the distinction between civil association and
        criminal culpability, and to import into criminal jurisprudence a form
        of vicarious liability which is impermissible in the absence of a
        specific statutory provision.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 411 of 549
   861.                     If such an inference were to be accepted, it would lead to
        the untenable proposition that any person receiving funds from third
        parties, merely because of their acquaintance or proximity to another
        accused, could be treated as a proxy for that accused, thereby
        rendering both liable. Such a standard would stretch criminal
        culpability beyond its permissible limits and would effectively
        criminalise ordinary financial transactions unsupported by evidence of
        control, benefit, or mens rea. Criminal law does not recognise guilt by
        association, nor does it permit the attribution of liability on the basis
        of speculative linkage or assumed influence.
                                                               (emphasis supplied)

   862.                     On a cumulative consideration of these circumstances,
        the material reflects short-term loans routed through banking channels,
        extended on the basis of personal familiarity and repaid within defined
        timelines. The record does not disclose any coordinated funding
        mechanism attributable to A-17. In the absence of evidence
        demonstrating direction, control or financial contribution by A-17
        towards the alleged investment, no inference of conspiracy can be
        drawn against A-5 or any other accused on this basis. The allegation
        appears to be an attempt to connect A-17 with A-5, which does not
        cross the threshold required even at the stage of charge.

        (iv) Allegation of Undue Benefit Through the Alleged Sham Land
        Deal between A-17 and A-23, in Turn Getting Favour in the Auction
        of Retail Zones under DEP-21/22

   863.                     The prosecution alleges that A-23 conferred an undue
        benefit upon A-17 through a purportedly sham land transaction, which
        is sought to be projected as the quid pro quo for the award of retail
        liquor zones under the Delhi DEP-21/22. Though the land transaction
        has been adverted to in the preceding paragraphs, it is necessary to
        address this allegation in its correct legal perspective.

   864.                     It is an admitted position on record that the alleged land
        deal was never consummated. The agreement to sell did not culminate
        in any transfer of title, and the amount paid pursuant to the agreement
        was admittedly returned. Notwithstanding this, the prosecution has
        advanced a speculative theory that A-17 entered into the agreement
        only to temporarily park funds in her account, allegedly to utilise the
        same during the intervening period before returning it. Crucially, the
        prosecution has failed to disclose any material whatsoever
        demonstrating how the said amount was utilised, for what purpose, or
        in what manner it was connected to the alleged conspiracy relating to
        the Excise Policy. In the absence of any such foundational material,
        the hypothesis remains conjectural.

   865.                     The law is well settled that an investigating agency
        cannot supply motives, invent purposes, or attribute criminal intent in
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 413 of 549
        the absence of cogent evidence. A simple commercial transaction,
        namely, execution of an agreement to sell, payment of advance, failure
        of the transaction, and refund of the amount, has been sought to be
        converted into incriminatory material by superimposing an
        unsubstantiated allegation that the property was agreed to be sold at a
        price higher than the prevailing market value. This Court finds it
        difficult to discern how such an allegation, even if assumed to be
        correct, establishes any nexus between A-17 and the formulation or
        implementation of the Excise Policy.

   866.                     The entire allegation thus rests on the hypothesis that
        companies linked with A-23 were conferred undue benefit in the award
        of retail zones, and that such benefit constituted the quid pro quo for
        the alleged land transaction. This foundational assumption, however,
        collapses upon scrutiny. The award of retail zones was conducted
        through a public auction process, supervised by the TEC, and in
        accordance with the prescribed statutory and procedural framework.
        Significantly, the investigating agency does not dispute the legality,
        regularity, or procedural compliance of the tender process itself. Once
        the validity of the auction and the award of zones stands undisputed,
        the prosecution’s theory that the allotment of retail zones constituted
        an illegal favour or undue benefit is rendered inherently
        unsustainable.
                                                              (emphasis supplied)

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 414 of 549
   867.                     The maxim sublato fundamento cadit opus, when the
        foundation is removed, the superstructure falls, aptly applies. Where
        the very foundation of the prosecution’s case, namely the existence of
        an illegal or irregular award of retail zones, is absent, the
        superstructure built upon it, alleging quid pro quo through a sham land
        deal, cannot survive. The law does not permit an inference of
        corruption or conspiracy to be drawn merely because two events are
        temporally proximate, in the absence of proof of causative linkage or
        unlawful benefit.

   868.                     Equally instructive is the principle post hoc ergo propter
        hoc, which cautions against the fallacy of assuming that because one
        event follows another, the former must be the cause of the latter. The
        prosecution’s case, in the present context, rests precisely on this
        impermissible reasoning, seeking to infer quid pro quo solely on the
        basis of sequence, without establishing nexus, intent, or benefit.

   869.                     Viewed thus, the allegation that A-17 received undue
        benefit through a sham land deal in consideration of favour shown to
        A-23 in the award of retail zones is bereft of evidentiary foundation.
        In the absence of any material that the land transaction was a facade,
        that the funds were utilised for any unlawful purpose, or that the tender
        process was manipulated to confer benefit, the allegation remains
        speculative and legally unsustainable. At the stage of consideration of
        charge, such conjecture cannot substitute for prima facie material

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 415 of 549
        establishing the essential ingredients of quid pro quo, conspiracy, or
        abuse of official position.


        Outcome of Evaluation

   870.                     On a plain reading of the record, the very inclusion of
        A-17 and A-18 in the present case rests substantially upon the
        statements of PW-225 and his son, PW-226, who was later tendered
        pardon. It is essentially through these two witnesses that A-17 and
        A-18 are brought within the alleged conspiracy. It is equally
        significant that, on the basis of these statements, the timeline of the
        alleged conspiracy itself shifts. The prosecution initially projected the
        conspiracy as having taken shape around April/May. After reliance
        upon PW-225 and PW-226, the starting point is pushed back to March.
        The chronology, therefore, stands altered primarily on the strength of
        accomplice-like statement.

   871.                     The only material relied upon to indicate any linkage
        between A-17 and A-18 is the statement of PW-225. According to him,
        when he met A-18, he was told that A-17 would call him. Beyond this
        assertion, no circumstance, meeting, communication, or overt act is
        attributed to them jointly. Notwithstanding the absence of any further
        material, they have been portrayed as principal actors operating
        through intermediaries.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 416 of 549
   872.                     In this admitted background certain features deserve
        notice:

        1. It is not the case of the prosecution that A-17 or A-18 attended any
        meeting in Delhi.
        2. It is not alleged that they attended any meeting in Hyderabad.
        3.A-17 never met A-8 during the relevant period.
        4. A-17 and A-18 never met each other during the period of the alleged
        conspiracy.
        5. A-17 did not come to Delhi during the relevant period.
   873.                     The prosecution version further states that PW-225
        visited the residence of A-17 in March, where she allegedly stated that
        she had to arrange ₹100 crores as “upfront money.” The manner in
        which this allegation is presented suggests that, even before the
        alleged June meeting of co-conspirators, the entire arrangement stood
        settled. This would mean that one person had already anticipated a
        collective decision that was yet to take place. Instead of strengthening
        the case, the introduction of PW-225 and PW-226 renders the theory
        internally strained.
                                                             (emphasis supplied)

   874.                     The link sought to be drawn with A-23 is through a land
        transaction in July, described as sham and treated as recoupment. Yet
        the prosecution’s own theory suggests that recoupment was to begin
        only after implementation of the policy and generation of profits.
        Profits would arise only upon commencement of sales, and credit

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 417 of 549
        notes could follow only thereafter. Credit notes cannot exist in the
        absence of sales. The timeline emerging from the record does not sit
        comfortably with the alleged mode of recoupment.

   875.                     To add weight to the narrative, it is alleged that ₹10
        crores were received from PW-226. The attempt to corroborate this
        through PW-227 remains unsatisfactory, as he does not specify the
        exact date, place, or time of delivery. The link, therefore, remains
        incomplete.

   876.                     It is further alleged that ₹10 crores and ₹15 crores were
        received at Chennai, not Hyderabad, and thereafter routed to Delhi and
        then to Goa. This gives rise to a simple and natural question: if the
        destination was Goa, and the prosecution itself relies upon
        Angadia/hawala channels, why was the amount not sent directly to
        Goa? Instead, several intermediaries are introduced. PA Ashok
        Kaushik is then shown as collecting the amount from approver PW-20.
        This again raises a basic query, why was the amount not delivered
        directly to him or directly to A-21? Why was it passed through
        multiple hands, thereby increasing risk and complexity?

   877.                     Most importantly, how did the amount reach Delhi in the
        first place? On this aspect, the prosecution narrative remains silent.

   878.                     At this stage, while the Court may grant the prosecution
        reasonable latitude, it cannot dispense with a meaningful application


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 418 of 549
        of mind. Even if the material is taken at face value, a straightforward
        reading raises doubts as to whether the investigation has traced a
        coherent chain, or whether isolated events have been placed together
        to create the appearance of a larger design.

   879.            The case is projected against a background of sensational and
        striking features:

        1. A 36-page printout allegedly becoming the GoM report.
        2. Allegations of ₹90–100 crores in illegal gratification.
        3. Involvement of public servants at high levels, businessmen, and
        media persons.
        4. Allegations of bribe-taking by government officials.
        5. An alleged connection with Goa elections.
        6. Multiple participants turning approvers and giving successive
        statements.
   880.                     Viewed casually, such elements may create an
        impression of a sweeping and well-organised conspiracy. The
        narrative appears structured. The scale of the alleged amounts and the
        range of persons involved can lend it an air of inevitability.

   881.                     But criminal law does not proceed on impression. It
        proceeds on admissible material. On closer examination, the apparent
        coherence rests largely on statements of witnesses who stand on
        similar footing. One accomplice-like witness is shown to support
        another. The approver’s version is said to be strengthened by a witness


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 419 of 549
        whose own role, as per the prosecution, is not free from suspicion.
        This is not independent corroboration; it is mutual reinforcement.

   882.                     The settled rule of prudence is that an accomplice may
        be examined, but his statement requires independent corroboration on
        material particulars. One tainted statement cannot lend legitimacy to
        another equally tainted statement. When PW-225, PW-226 and others
        forming part of the same alleged chain are relied upon to support each
        other, the Court must look for something outside that circle,
        documentary proof, financial trail, or electronic record, standing
        independently. If such independent material is absent, the narrative
        does not appear internally consistent and remains legally fragile.

   883.                     Even when each statement is assumed to be true, the
        structure does not appear intact when taken together. The fragility
        becomes more pronounced when each link is examined separately,
        date, place, mode of transfer, route of movement, whereupon the gaps
        become visible. Essential facts are left to inference. The route of
        money is unclear. The timing does not align. The alleged recoupment
        precedes the very profits from which it is said to arise.

   884.                     This is one of those cases where, unless the material is
        tested on the touchstone of admissibility and relevance, the story may
        appear complete. The magnitude of the allegations can overshadow
        the weaknesses. Yet, when examined in the light of established


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 420 of 549
        principles governing accomplice statement and corroboration, the
        apparent superstructure begins to lose stability.

   885.                     Courts cannot permit the force of a narrative to replace
        the discipline of evidence. However serious the allegations may
        appear, they must withstand scrutiny under settled legal principles.
        When so examined, what is projected as a single, coherent design may,
        in truth, consist of a chain of assertions resting upon one another,
        without firm and independent support. The maxim sublato
        fundamento cadit opus aptly applies, when the foundation is removed,
        the structure falls. Like a pack of cards, once the base is unsettled, the
        entire arrangement begins to give way. That is precisely what has
        occurred here. Once the primary reliance on mutually supporting
        accomplice-like statements is tested, the apparent coherence dissolves,
        and the larger structure cannot sustain itself.
                                                                (emphasis supplied)


        Allegation against A-19

   886.                     As per the prosecution case set out in the Fourth
        Supplementary Charge-sheet, A-19, Durgesh Pathak, is alleged to have
        played a role in the utilisation of the purported proceeds of crime
        arising out of the alleged Excise Policy conspiracy for political
        purposes, specifically in connection with the Goa Assembly Elections,
        2022. The prosecution projects A-19 as the AAP Prabhari/In-charge

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 421 of 549
        for Goa during the relevant period and alleges that, by virtue of this
        position, he exercised supervisory and coordinating control over the
        party’s election campaign in the State.

   887.                     It is alleged that, during the course of the Goa election
        campaign, A-19 approached candidates and party workers and assured
        them that their election expenses would be borne by the party.
        According to the prosecution, such assurances indicated the existence
        of a centrally managed funding mechanism for the campaign. The
        prosecution relies upon statements of certain AAP candidates and
        witnesses to allege that election-related expenditure in Goa was
        incurred substantially in cash and that candidates were informed that
        they need not independently arrange campaign funds.

   888.                     The prosecution further alleges that cash amounts
        transferred to Goa through hawala/angadiya channels, described as
        part of the alleged upfront money generated from the Excise Policy
        conspiracy, were utilised for meeting election-related expenses under
        the supervision of the Goa campaign leadership. In this context, it is
        alleged that A-19 utilised such funds through accused Chanpreet Singh
        Rayat (A-16), who is stated to have handled and disbursed cash
        payments to various vendors, assembly managers, booth in-charges,
        volunteers and other personnel engaged in the Goa election campaign.
        The prosecution thus attributes to A-19 a coordinating role in the
        utilisation of the alleged cash funds through on-ground operatives.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 422 of 549
   889.                     In support of the broader conspiracy narrative, the
        prosecution also relies on circumstances relating to meetings and
        logistics in Delhi. It is alleged that on 21.05.2021 certain accused
        persons, described as members of the so-called “South Group”, met
        accused Vijay Nair (A-3) and others at Gauri Apartment near
        Claridges, Delhi, and that this meeting was connected with the alleged
        conspiracy relating to the Excise Policy. In this backdrop, it is
        specifically alleged that the said guest house/apartment had been
        booked by Sh. Bibhav Kumar, Personal Secretary to accused Arvind
        Kejriwal (A-18), for A-19. The prosecution cites this circumstance as
        part of the chain suggesting coordination among political functionaries
        and other accused during the relevant period.

   890.                     The prosecution further alleges that the transfer of funds
        to Goa was undertaken with the object of financing the AAP’s Goa
        election campaign and that A-19, as Goa Prabhari, played a role in the
        political utilisation of such funds. According to the prosecution, the
        alleged cash disbursements formed part of a larger plan to deploy the
        proceeds of the alleged Excise Policy conspiracy for electoral
        expenditure, and A-19 is alleged to have been one of the key political
        coordinators in Goa in this regard.

   891.                     It is the prosecution’s stated position that the acts
        attributed to A-19 are not connected with the discharge of any official
        duty, and on that basis it is asserted that no sanction under Section 19

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 423 of 549
        of the PC Act is required in respect of A-19. The prosecution alleges
        that, on the aforesaid factual matrix, A-19 was a participant in the
        criminal conspiracy relating to the utilisation of alleged proceeds of
        crime for political purposes, in furtherance of the overall conspiracy
        alleged in the Fourth Supplementary Charge-sheet.


        Analysis

   892.                     The prosecution seeks to attribute criminal liability to
        A-19 primarily on the premise that, being the Goa Prabhari of the party
        during the Goa Assembly Elections, 2022, he approached prospective
        candidates and assured them that the party would bear election-related
        expenses. Even if this allegation is assumed to be correct in its entirety,
        such conduct, by itself, does not disclose any violation of the election
        law framework.

   893.                     Under the scheme of the Representation of the People
        Act, 1951, election expenditure incurred by or authorised by a political
        party is legally distinct from the personal election expenditure of a
        candidate. Section 77(1) of the Representation Act, 1951 (hereinafter
        referred to as “R.P. Act, 1951”) mandates that a candidate shall
        maintain a correct account of expenditure “incurred or authorised by
        him” in connection with his election. The Explanation to Section 77,
        read with settled election law jurisprudence, clarifies that expenditure
        incurred by a recognised political party or by persons other than the

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 424 of 549
        candidate, without the candidate’s authorisation, does not form part of
        the candidate’s election expenditure. Political parties are statutorily
        permitted to campaign for, support, and financially assist their
        candidates, subject to disclosure norms applicable to the party. There
        is no prohibition in law against a political party funding or meeting the
        campaign expenses of its candidates, and such funding, per se, does
        not attract any penal consequence under the Act.
                                                              (emphasis supplied)

   894.                     Further, the regulatory framework under Section 29C of
        the R.P. Act, 1951, expressly contemplates party funding and mandates
        disclosure of contributions received by political parties beyond the
        prescribed threshold. The alleged assurance by A-19 that the party
        would bear election expenses, even if taken at face value, therefore
        falls squarely within the domain of permissible political conduct and
        cannot, without more, be elevated to criminality.

   895.                     Significantly, the prosecution has not placed any
        material to show that A-19 either provided cash, arranged cash,
        directed cash payments, or acted as a conduit for the alleged cash
        utilised in the elections. The statements relied upon by the prosecution,
        including those of PW-273 and PW-274, do not attribute any act of
        cash handling, transfer, receipt or disbursement to A-19, nor do they
        suggest that any cash was provided by him or on his behalf. The mere
        assertion that party volunteers or campaign functionaries incurred

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 425 of 549
        expenditure in cash does not, in the absence of linkage evidence,
        establish any role of A-19 in the alleged funding trail.

   896.                     The Court further notes that political supervision of
        elections by a party functionary is a routine and legitimate
        organisational activity. The role of a ‘Prabhari’ is inherently
        supervisory and coordinative in nature. Such supervision cannot be
        criminalised merely because the prosecution alleges that some party
        workers or volunteers may have utilised cash during the campaign. To
        fasten criminal liability on A-19 on a theory of vicarious responsibility,
        the prosecution was required to demonstrate that the alleged recipients
        or handlers of cash were acting as his agents, co-conspirators or at his
        behest. No such material has been placed on record.

   897.                     It is also an admitted position emerging from the charge-
        sheet itself that A-19 was not present at any of the meetings projected
        as the genesis or crystallisation of the alleged conspiracy, including
        the meetings at Gauri Apartment, ITC Kohinoor, Taj Hotel or Hotel
        Oberoi. His name does not figure in the confessional or approver
        statements of PW-20 or PW-226, nor in the statements of any angadia,
        hawala operator or witness connected with the alleged cash movement.
        None of the witnesses who speak of alleged transfer of funds from
        Delhi to Goa have named or implicated A-19 in any capacity.

   898.                     The sole foundation of the prosecution case against A-19
        thus rests on the assertion that he was supervising the Goa elections
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 426 of 549
        while alleged cash was received and spent by party volunteers. Such a
        premise, in the absence of evidence of knowledge, participation,
        control or linkage with the alleged proceeds of crime, is legally
        insufficient to sustain a criminal charge. Criminal conspiracy cannot
        be inferred from organisational hierarchy or political position alone; it
        must be founded on material demonstrating a meeting of minds and
        conscious participation, which is conspicuously absent in the present
        case.

   899.                     In the absence of any allegation or evidence that A-19
        was instrumental in the generation, transfer, receipt or utilisation of
        the alleged cash, or that he was connected in any manner with the
        formulation or implementation of the Excise Policy, there is no
        material whatsoever to justify his arraignment. The attempt to rope
        him in on the basis of a broad and impermissible theory of vicarious
        liability does not meet the threshold required even at the stage of
        framing of charge.

   900.                     The Court expresses its serious disapproval of the
        manner in which the investigating agency has sought to implicate A-19
        without placing on record any material indicative of his knowledge,
        participation or involvement in the alleged conspiracy or the alleged
        proceeds of crime. Criminal liability cannot be fastened on the basis
        of political position, organisational role or supervisory responsibility.
        To compel an individual to face criminal prosecution on the strength

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 427 of 549
        of conjecture and association is wholly impermissible and runs
        contrary to settled principles of criminal jurisprudence, where the
        process itself cannot be permitted to operate as punishment.

                                                               (emphasis supplied)

   901.                     The investigating agency is expected to act with fairness
        and restraint, particularly in cases carrying grave consequences for
        personal liberty, reputation and dignity. The present prosecution
        reflects an unwarranted expansion of the net in the absence of evidence
        and a failure to distinguish between legitimate political activity and
        criminal conduct. Continuation of proceedings founded on such
        tenuous premises would amount to an abuse of process and result in a
        miscarriage of justice.

        Allegation Against A-20

   902.                     It is the prosecution case that A-20 Amit Arora, owner
        and controller of M/S Buddy Beverages Pvt. Ltd., emerged during
        investigation as a participant in the alleged conspiracy relating to the
        Delhi DEP-21/22. It is alleged that he acted in concert with accused
        Vijay Nair (A-3) and approver Dinesh Arora to extract an illegal
        commission of 6% out of the 12% wholesale margin introduced under
        the DEP-21/22.

   903.                     According to the prosecution, M/S Mahadev Liquors, a
        wholesale licensee in Delhi, was targeted for payment of the said

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 428 of 549
        commission. Upon refusal, A-20 is alleged to have adopted coercive
        measures, including misuse of alleged influence with Punjab Excise
        authorities, resulting in abrupt closure of liquor manufacturing units
        linked to Ms. Jasdeep Kaur Chadha (PW-298) in Punjab. It is alleged
        that such actions were intended to pressurise M/S Mahadev Liquors to
        comply with the demand.

   904.                     The prosecution further alleges that the distilleries of
        Ms. Jasdeep Kaur Chadha (PW-298) were closed without prior notice,
        followed by issuance of a show-cause notice, and that she was
        thereafter directed to donate ₹51 lakhs to the Chief Minister’s Relief
        Fund, Punjab, after which orders for reopening were issued. It is
        alleged that continued pressure led to surrender of the wholesale
        licence of M/S Mahadev Liquors on 25.05.2022.

   905.                     It is also alleged that approver Dinesh Arora (PW-20)
        confirmed that closure of the Punjab units was orchestrated to exert
        pressure for payment of the 6% commission, and that after Mahadev
        Liquors exited the wholesale business, alternative entities, M/S Dewan
        Spirits and M/S Shiv Associates, were identified to whom the business
        could be shifted on terms involving sharing of the commission. The
        prosecution relies upon statements of certain witnesses, including Sh.
        Sanjit Padhi and Sh. Prabhjot Singh, to allege that A-20 Amit Arora
        was a participant in these arrangements and thereby played a role in



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 429 of 549
        extraction of illegal commission and coercive restructuring of
        wholesale arrangements under the DEP-21/22.

        Analysis

   906.                     At the very threshold, it requires emphasis that A-20
        Amit Arora is admittedly not shown to have been present in any of the
        meetings which, according to the prosecution itself, are projected as
        forming the fulcrum or crucible of the alleged conspiracy, namely, the
        meetings at Gauri Apartments, ITC Kohinoor, Hyderabad, Taj Hotel,
        or Hotel Oberoi. His absence from each and every meeting said to have
        shaped, advanced, or operationalised the alleged conspiracy is borne
        out from the record and, significantly, stands undisputed by the
        prosecution.

   907.                     This absence assumes added significance when viewed
        in the backdrop of the prosecution’s own foundational narrative. In the
        principal charge-sheet, the prosecution proceeds on an entirely
        different and self-contained axis. The alleged conspiracy is premised
        on the assertion that major manufacturers, particularly M/S PRI and
        Diageo, together commanded nearly 65% of the market share, and that
        the DEP-21/22 was allegedly manipulated to enable control over
        distribution so as to facilitate recoupment of so-called “upfront
        money.” Within this core narrative, M/S Mahadev Liquors, an L-1
        wholesaler, does not figure at all. There is not even a remote allegation
        connecting A-20 Amit Arora either with the alleged payment or with
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 430 of 549
        the alleged recoupment of upfront money. The subsequent
        introduction of an altogether new strand involving M/S Mahadev
        Liquors, without any demonstrable linkage to the original conspiracy
        framework, thus constitutes an unexplained and material departure
        from the prosecution’s own central theory.

   908.                     It is also an undisputed position that no role whatsoever
        is attributed to A-20 at the stage of formulation of the DEP-21/22. He
        is neither alleged to be a manufacturer, nor a wholesaler, nor a retailer,
        except in relation to the Airport zone through Buddy Retails Pvt. Ltd.,
        under the DEP-21/22. There is no allegation that he influenced,
        approached, or interacted with any public servant in connection with
        policy        drafting,    Cabinet   approval,   movement     of     files,      or
        implementation. His name is conspicuously absent from any
        contemporaneous policy-level discussion, official correspondence, or
        decision-making record pertaining to the Excise Department. This
        absence from the policy domain materially weakens any attempt to
        attribute to him a role in a policy-centric criminal conspiracy.

   909.                     Equally telling is the complete absence of any
        allegation, direct or indirect, linking A-20 with the delivery,
        movement, receipt, or handling of any alleged cash, whether at
        Chennai, Delhi, or Goa. None of the witnesses examined in relation to
        hawala transactions, angadiya operations, or alleged cash movement
        have named A-20. He does not find mention in the statements of the

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 431 of 549
        approvers, including PW-20 or PW-226, in relation to the alleged cash
        trail or election expenditure. The prosecution material, therefore,
        discloses no financial or transactional nexus between A-20 and the
        alleged proceeds of crime.

   910.                     When the focus shifts to M/S Mahadev Liquors, the
        record itself discloses multiple and mutually inconsistent versions
        regarding its control and operation. The first version emanates from
        approver PW-20 Dines Arora, who stated that PW-298 (Ms. Jasdeep
        Kaur Chadha) was the owner of M/S Mahadev Liquors, “Mahadev
        Liquor ke owner hai Madam Chaddha”, as reflected in the confession
        statement recorded under Section 164 of Cr.P.C.. A second version,
        again attributed to approver PW-20, suggests that PW-298 was
        running the business though Sunny Marwah (PW-279), as disclosed in
        the statement recorded under Section 161 of Cr.P.C. dated 21.09.2022.
        A third version, disclosed by PW-298 and PW-279 themselves, is that
        they were merely family friends and that PW-279 was the owner of
        M/S Mahadev Liquors.

   911.                     The investigating agency has consciously chosen to
        adopt and rely upon the third version. The reason for this selective
        reliance becomes apparent on closer scrutiny. Acceptance of either the
        first or the second version would inevitably lead to the inference that
        a manufacturer was effectively running a distributor/wholesaler, a
        situation expressly prohibited under the NEP-20/21, particularly when

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                    Page no. 432 of 549
        PW-298 admittedly controlled liquor manufacturing entities such as
        Tite Beverages, Medusa Beverages, Adie Browson Breweries, and AB
        Grains Spirits Pvt. Ltd. This circumstance also bears directly on the
        manner in which Sunny Marwah (PW-279) was initially named as an
        accused in the FIR. It is pertinent that while A-7 and A-9, being
        wholesalers, have been charge-sheeted, neither Sunny Marwah nor
        Jasdeep Kaur Chadha has been charge-sheeted. The third version,
        therefore, aligns conveniently with the investigative narrative by
        insulating both Jasdeep Kaur Chadha (PW-298) and Sunny Marwah
        (PW-279) from the rigours of a prohibited relationship, while
        simultaneously rendering their statements amenable to prosecutorial
        use.

   912.                     Proceeding   on   this   constructed   premise,         the
        investigating agency seeks to link the alleged closure of distilleries
        belonging to PW-298 with an alleged attempt to exert pressure upon
        PW-279, projected as one of the owners of M/S Mahadev Liquors. The
        prosecution further suggests that, being a family friend and having
        suffered inconvenience and financial loss, PW-298 influenced the
        decision of M/S Mahadev Liquors to surrender its L-1 licence. This
        theory of “arm-twisting,” however, does not withstand scrutiny. Such
        a hypothesis might have carried some plausibility had there been an
        allegation that PW-279 extended financial assistance to PW-298 to
        offset her alleged losses. Instead, the prosecution’s own case is that

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 433 of 549
        M/S Mahadev Liquors was running a successful L-1 wholesale
        business with nearly 20% market share in Delhi under the DEP-21/22
        and was projected as the third-largest wholesaler in the city. PW-279
        is stated to have been dealing with as many as 14 brands. Against this
        commercial backdrop, the suggestion that a profitable wholesaler
        would voluntarily surrender its licence merely out of sympathy or
        familial concern, without any corresponding financial or commercial
        benefit, appears inherently implausible. In this backdrop, if the theory
        is to be accepted as giving rise to grave suspicion, the prosecution was
        required to show, at least prima facie, that there existed a relationship
        of such a nature that PW-298 was compelled or constrained to
        surrender the licence. No such material is forthcoming on record. On
        the contrary, another view equally arises from the circumstances, that
        the surrender was occasioned by the withdrawal of the Excise Policy
        itself. Unless this alternative is ruled out on the basis of cogent
        material, the prosecution’s suggestion cannot be said to cross the
        threshold beyond mere conjecture.

   913.                     The prosecution case then suffers a decisive and fatal
        jolt with the admitted denial of sanction under Section 17-A of the PC
        Act qua the Punjab Excise officials. The relevant extract of the order
        dated 30.08.2023 of the competent authority, marked as D-368, is
        reproduced for ready reference:

                “…..GOVERNMENT OF PUNJAB DEPARTMENT OF
                PERSONNEL (I.A.S. BRANCH)
                                             ORDER
                        The Central Bureau of Investigation, New Delhi, vide
                Memo No. 5365/RC 53(A)/2022/CBI/ACB/DLI dated
                30.08.2023, had sent a proposal regarding seeking of
                permission u/s 17A of PC Act. 1988 (as amended in 2018)
                against Sh. KAP Sinha, IAS (Punjab-1992), the then Financial
                Commissioner, Excise & Taxation, Punjab.
                2.       On receipt of the aforesaid proposal, the Financial
                Commissioner (Taxation) was requested vide Memo No.
                SV-3/134 dated 08.09.2023 to give factual position in this case.
                The Financial Commissioner (Taxation) has communicated the
                factual report, vide his Memo No. 2056 dated 09.10.2023.
                3.        Based on the above factual position placed before the
                Competent Authority, it has come out that the Department of
                Excise and Taxation conducts routine inspections of the
                distilleries and bottling plants from time to time. So, as a part
                of routine practice, 15 inspections of various manufacturing
                units were conducted in the months of April and May, 2022. It
                becomes clear that the units of M/S A.B Grains Spirits Pvt. Ltd.
                and M/S Adie Broswon Pvt. Ltd. were not specifically targeted
                for inspections. It has been reported that similar inspections
                had been conducted in the past also. As a result of such routine
                inspections in four units during the month of Nov. 2021, action
                as per law was initiated which resulted into imposing of penalty
                of Rs. 80 Lakhs in the month of April 2022 in three cases each,
                and in one case, the license of the unit remained suspended for
                fifteen days.
                4.      It clearly shows that the Department has been
                handling such cases as per the provisions of the Punjab Excise
                Act and the Excise Rules. Similarly, in cases of M/S A.B
                Grains Spirits Pvt. Ltd. and M/S Adie Broswon Pvt. Ltd.,
                action as per law was taken by the competent officer and
                nothing malafide can be attributed to the competent officer

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 435 of 549
                when he has duly discharged his duties. It is also pertinent to
                mention here that neither any appeal nor any revision was filed
                by the aforesaid liquor companies before Shri KAP Sinha, IAS,
                the then Financial Commissioner, Excise & Taxation, Punjab.
                5.       Further, linking the surrender of L-1 (wholesale)
                license by M/S Mahadev Liquors in New Delhi with the
                departmental action, taken as per law, against a manufacturing
                unit in Punjab run by Smt. Jasdeep Kaur Chadha is not tenable.
                As per the factual record as received from the CBI, M/S
                Mahadev Liquors is a proprietorship concern with Sh. Sunny
                Marwaha as an authorized signatory. There is nothing on
                record which establishes any linkage of M/S Mahadev Liquors
                with Smt. Jasdeep Kaur Chadha or her concerns in Punjab.
                6.      From the sequence of events and the facts placed on
                record, the Competent Authority is of the view that giving a
                colour of arm twisting to the routine legal departmental action
                taken against M/S A.B Grains Spirits Pvt. Ltd. and M/S Adie
                Broswon Pvt. Ltd., is unjustified. Moreover, the CBI itself has
                mentioned categorically in the proforma that they do not have
                any information in respect of any bribe giver.
                7…..The ingredients of Section 477A of IPC has been gone
                through in light of the documents provided by CBI in the
                proposal but no falsification of accounts done by Shri K A P
                Sinha, IAS has been mentioned anywhere in the documents
                provided by CBI, nor it has been found on perusal of the record
                of the Department of Excise, Punjab related to Shri K A P Sinha
                IAS. Thus, no case of section 477A of IPC is made out
                against Shri K A P Sinha, IAS.
                8…… In regard to an allegation under the aforesaid Section of
                IPC, it is mentioned that as per the copy of FIR provided by
                CBI, M/S Mahadev Liquors is a proprietorship concern having
                Sh. Sunny Marwaha as an authorized signatory. No fact of
                linkage of M/S Mahadev Liquors with Smt. Jasdeep Kaur
                Chadha has been mentioned in the copy of FIR nor in any other
                supporting documents provided by CBI. Further, it has been
                found that no other document or evidence has been provided

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 436 of 549
                by CBI, which can possibly attract any ingredient invoking
                section 120B of IPC against Sh. K A P Sinha IAS.
                9….. In regard to an allegation under this Section of PC Act,
                it is mentioned that in para 8 of the proposal received from CBI
                seeking permission u/s 17A PC Act, 1988 against Shri K A P
                Sinha, IAS, it is stated that there is no information available
                with CBI in respect of any bribe giver. Moreover, as per the fact
                finding report of Excise Department, neither any
                document/evidence has been found from record of the Excise
                Department nor from the proposal received from CBI which
                indicates any deliberate disruption in the functioning of the
                afore-mentioned Units, as claimed by CBI. Further, as already
                mentioned above, no fact of linkage of M/S Mahadev Liquors
                with Smt. Jasdeep Kaur Chadha has been mentioned in the
                copy of FIR nor in any other supporting documents provided
                by CBI. Thus, no ingredient of Section 7 of PC Act, 1988 (as
                amended in 2018) has been made out in the case of Shri K A
                P Sinha, IAS.
                10.     Further, at the time, Shri K A P Sinha, IAS was posted
                as Additional Chief Secretary Finance with Additional Charge
                of Additional Chief Secretary Excise and Taxation. Holding
                these two positions simultaneously, his most important
                assignment at that time was to prepare the maiden budget of the
                new Government which was to be presented on 27th June,
                2022. His additional charge as Additional Chief Secretary
                Excise and Taxation was only for a short duration of 2 months
                18 days.
                11.     In view of the aforegoing, Competent Authority, after
                having examined in depth the request of the CBI coupled with
                the facts as stated above, is of a categorical view that no case
                whatsoever is made out to grant any sort of "permission" under
                Section 17A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988
                against Shri K A P Sinha, IAS, the then Financial
                Commissioner, Excise & Taxation, Punjab who has carried out
                his official functions/duties in a bona-fide manner. The
                provisions of Section 17A were also examined, which postulate

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 437 of 549
                a mandatory pre-requisite of previous approval before
                conduct of any inquiry, enquiry or investigation against a
                Public Servant. No case for such previous approval is made
                out. Though, the CBI has sought for ‘permission’, but the
                statute distinctly uses the expression ‘previous approval’.
                Obviously, ‘previous approval’ would be of a distinct nature
                than a mere 'permission'. The Competent Authority is satisfied
                that the accusations set forth in the CBI's proposal does not
                disclose a prima facie criminality in the acts of the concerned
                public servant. As stated above, not even a prima facie case is
                made out for according any previous approval under Section
                17A (supra) and accordingly, the request of the CBI is hereby
                declined.
                12.    This issues with the approval of the Competent
                Authority.
                                   Chief Secretary to the Government of Punjab
                                            Endst. No. 2/7/2023-IAS(1)/1044
                                            Dated, Chandigarh 28.11.2023…”.


   914.                     The alleged closure of distilleries belonging to PW-298
        in Punjab constitutes the very foundation of the prosecution’s theory
        of coercion and misuse of official machinery. However, the competent
        authority declined sanction to investigate the said officials, and the
        denial order (D-368) admittedly remains unchallenged by the CBI.
        This omission has serious legal consequences. The Supreme Court in
        case titled as Karnataka Emta Coal Mines Ltd. V. CBI, 2024 SCC
        OnLine SC 2250, has consistently held that where sanction to
        prosecute a public servant is refused and such refusal is not assailed,
        allegations of conspiracy involving private persons premised upon the
        conduct of such public servants cannot be sustained. Non-challenge to
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 438 of 549
        the denial order, therefore, amounts to acceptance of the findings of
        the competent authority by the investigating agency itself. The
        relevant extract is reproduced below for ready reference:

                                                          (emphasis supplied)

                “….12. DENIAL OF SANCTIONS BY THE SANCTIONING
                AUTHORITIES AND THE EFFECT ON THE
                APPELLANTS
                12.1. It is relevant to note that the very same Audit objections
                taken by the CAG and relied upon by the respondent-CBI to
                allege conspiracy and loss to the public exchequer were
                thoroughly examined and found to be meritless by two separate
                set of Sanctioning Authorities. When it came to Mr. R.
                Nagaraja, the then Director (Finance) of KPCL and the
                nominee Director on the Board of KECML, the Sanctioning
                Authority, i.e., the Board of KPCL went through several
                documents during its deliberations including the MoU between
                the KECML and GCWL forwarded by the respondent-CBI for
                seeking sanction to prosecute him. The reasons for holding that
                the CAG Report was without any factual basis, were
                elaborately dealt with as below:
                12.2. It is apparent from the above that after Sanctioning
                Authority had scrutinized all the relevant documents and the
                depositions as many as of 67 witnesses submitted by the
                respondent-CBI, it observed that there was no evidence to
                show that any rejects generated by washing of coal had been
                sold or that KPCL had suffered an unlawful loss during the
                process. As a result, the Board of KPCL refused to grant
                sanction to the respondent-CBI to prosecute Mr. R. Nagaraja
                for offences alleged to have been committed by him. It is
                noteworthy that no appeal has been filed by the respondent -
                CBI against denial of sanction.
                12.3. Similarly, the request made by the respondent-CBI for
                seeking sanction to prosecute Mr. Yogendra Tripathi, the then

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 439 of 549
                Managing Director, KPCL was denied by the Competent
                Authority in the Central Government in terms of the letter
                dated 16th April, 2018, issued by the DoPT. The order passed
                by the DoPT shows that it took note of the Report of the
                respondent-CBI, the records submitted by it along with the
                Report, the advice received from the CVC and then
                summarized the allegations levelled by the respondent-CBI
                that formed the basis of its proposal to seek sanction for
                prosecution of the aforesaid officer. The said request was
                finally rejected by the Competent Authority in the Central
                Government with the following observations:
                12.4. The aforesaid order reveals that before applying its mind,
                the Competent Authority in the Central Government had
                sought comments from the Government of Karnataka who had
                stated that there was no material produced by the respondent-
                CBI in support of the allegation that Mr. Yogendra Tripathi had
                conspired to illegally dispose off the coal rejects or
                with malafide intention deferred the agenda in the 41st Board
                Meeting of the KPCL. The Competent Authority separately
                sent the said proposal submitted by the respondent-CBI to the
                CVC for seeking advice. After examining all the records sent
                by the investigation agency including the evidence submitted
                by it, the Office of the Prime Minister who is the Competent
                Authority in the Central Government, approved the proposal to
                decline the sanction for prosecuting Mr. Yogendra Tripathi. Yet
                again, no appeal has been filed by the respondent - CBI
                before the court questioning the said decision.
                12.5. The respondent-CBI having accepted the decision taken
                by the Sanctioning Authority in respect of Mr. R. Nagaraja and
                the decision of the Competent Authority in the Central
                Government in respect of Mr. Yogendra Tripathi, both senior
                most serving officers of KPCL and were also on the Board of
                KECML, cannot be permitted to argue that these were merely
                administrative decisions and even if permission to prosecute
                the aforesaid officers has been denied, the Department can still
                proceed against the appellants based on the very same set of
                material/documents/evidence etc. that have been minutely
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 440 of 549
                scrutinized by different authorities at the highest level and they
                have independently arrived at an identical conclusion of
                refusing to grant sanction to prosecute senior functionaries of
                KPCL. Simply because the said senior functionaries of KPCL
                were public servants, does not detract from the fact that the
                respondent-CBI has described them as co-accused in a criminal
                conspiracy and attributed similar motives to them as the
                appellants herein. If they have been let off the hook and the
                respondent-CBI has not challenged the said decisions, there is
                no reason to proceed against the appellants herein on the basis
                of the very same set of facts and material gathered during the
                course of investigation.
                (d) The Competent Authority in the Central Government who
                was approached by the respondent-CBI for sanction to
                prosecute Mr. Yogendra Tripathi, the then Managing Director
                of KPCL sought comments from two separate sources. The
                Government of Karnataka opined that no criminal intent
                could be attributed to the said officer. A proposal was also
                sent to the CVC for their advice. The CVC too recommended
                that the sanction for prosecuting the officer ought to be
                declined. The Competent Authority in the Central Government
                after going through the entire documents and material
                including the evidence submitted by the respondent-CBI and
                the opinions solicited, declined sanction for the prosecution of
                the aforesaid officer.
                (e) The respondent-CBI did not approach the Court to
                challenge the aforesaid decisions. Having accepted the
                decision taken by the Sanctioning Authority/Competent
                Authority in the Central Government and dropping the charges
                against the seniormost functionaries in KPCL, who were also
                holding positions in the Board of KECML, there is no
                justification to press charges against the appellants herein
                whose role is similar to them…”.
   915.                     Even otherwise, the prosecution narrative is riddled with
        internal inconsistencies of such magnitude that they render the

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                            Page no. 441 of 549
        allegations highly improbable. If M/S Mahadev Liquors had already
        surrendered its four brands, Radico Khaitan, Modi Distillery,
        Alcobrew, and Gemini Distillery, on 12 May, as allegedly demanded
        by A-20, the subsequent issuance of a show-cause notice calling
        PW-298 for personal hearing by the Punjab Excise Department
        becomes difficult to reconcile. Likewise, the allegation that Ms.
        Jasdeep Kaur Chadha was compelled to donate ₹51 lakhs to the Chief
        Minister’s Relief Fund, Punjab, by cheque and not in cash to any
        person, after surrender of the licence, does not logically advance the
        prosecution case of quid pro quo or policy-linked conspiracy. There is
        no allegation that the said amount was routed as cash, diverted towards
        election expenditure, or otherwise connected with the alleged Excise
        Policy conspiracy.

   916.                     Prima facie, therefore, no causal or transactional nexus
        emerges between the surrender of the wholesale licence in Delhi and
        the administrative action taken against distilleries in Punjab. This
        conclusion is further reinforced by the undisputed circumstance that
        the DEP-21/22 itself was due to expire in May, coinciding with the
        period of surrender. If A-20 and approver PW-20 were acting in
        furtherance of a criminal conspiracy, it remains unexplained what
        tangible benefit could have accrued from pressuring the surrender of
        an L-1 licence when the policy itself was nearing expiry and was
        ultimately extended only for two months by an order dated 20 May.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 442 of 549
        The hypothesis of extracting substantial benefit for such a fleeting
        period does not comport with ordinary commercial or conspiratorial
        logic. Taken cumulatively, the surrounding circumstances do not
        support the prosecution case; rather, they dismantle it.

   917.                     The   attempt    to   braid   these   independent           and
        jurisdictionally distinct strands into a single Excise Policy conspiracy
        is thus unsupported by cogent or reliable material. At the highest, the
        allegations, even if accepted at face value, may point towards a
        separate and independent grievance, but they do not disclose any
        material connection with either the formulation or the implementation
        of the DEP-21/22, nor with the alleged conspiracy underlying it.

   918.                     It is also of relevance that upon surrender of the licence
        by M/S Mahadev Liquors, the business was allegedly taken over by
        M/S Dewan Spirits and M/S Shiv Associates. Despite being the
        immediate beneficiaries, neither entity has been implicated as an
        accused. PW-307 Surjan Reddy of M/S Dewan Spirits has disclosed
        that approver PW-20 approached him for a 50% partnership. Approver
        PW-20, in his confessional statement, stated: “....On 30 aprail she
        surrendered the license and I got all her work I got L-1 license instead
        of Mahadev liquor. I got three companies and 1 company was given to
        M/S Deewan spirits….”.

   919.                     This disclosure squarely implicates Surjan Reddy and
        Prabhjot Singh of Shiv Associates. Considered cumulatively, these
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 443 of 549
        statements indicate that the witnesses, including Sunny Marwah and
        Jasdeep Kaur Chadha, are accomplice-like witnesses as showing
        proximity of manufacturer with wholesaler, whose statements require
        independent corroboration in material particulars. One accomplice
        cannot corroborate another, and uncorroborated statements of such
        nature cannot be acted upon even to raise a grave suspicion. Reliance
        is placed upon the judgments of Hon’ble Supreme Court in K. Hashim
        (supra), Somasundaram (supra), Laxmipat Choraria (supra) and A.R.
        Antulay (supra).

   920.                     In the complete absence of any role in policy
        formulation, absence from alleged conspiracy meetings, absence of
        involvement in any alleged cash movement, and absence of linkage to
        public-servant conduct or policy outcomes, this Court is constrained
        to hold that there is no prima facie material connecting A-20 Amit
        Arora with the alleged conspiracy relating to the DEP-21/22.

   921.                     Viewed thus, the material placed on record falls
        manifestly short of the essential ingredients of criminal conspiracy.
        Conspiracy in law presupposes a prior meeting of minds, an
        agreement, tacit or express, to commit an illegal act or a legal act by
        illegal means, and conscious participation in furtherance of the
        common design. Mere suspicion, association, parallel circumstances,
        or post-facto allegations, howsoever serious, cannot be treated as a
        material of such agreement. In the present case, there is no material

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                    Page no. 444 of 549
        indicating that A-20 Amit Arora was a participant in any policy-
        shaping discussion, any conspiracy meeting, any agreement for
        extraction of alleged illegal gratification, or any act in furtherance
        thereof. In the absence of evidence disclosing knowledge, intent, or
        participation, the foundational requirement of conspiracy remains
        wholly unfulfilled. Subjecting A-20 to trial on such slender and
        conjectural material would amount to permitting the prosecution to
        proceed on surmise rather than substance, which the law does not
        countenance.

        Allegations against A-23

   922.                     The prosecution alleges that A-23, Sarath Chandra
        Reddy, was a member of the so-called “South Group” and was part of
        the larger conspiracy relating to the DEP-21/22. It is alleged that an
        amount of ₹14 crores was obtained from him in the guise of a land
        transaction and that a further sum of ₹80 lakhs was paid by him to an
        NGO associated with A-17 (Ms. K. Kavitha). According to the
        prosecution, these payments were linked to the alleged conspiracy. It
        is further alleged that, though the policy capped allocation at two retail
        zones per entity, he secured control over five retail zones and thereby
        derived undue benefit.

   923.                     The prosecution also relies on his presence in Delhi
        between 14.03.2021 and 17.03.2021, during which meetings are stated
        to have taken place between members of the South Group and A-3
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 445 of 549
        (Vijay Nair), and a draft GoM Report was allegedly handed over and
        later formalised. Reference is also made to the meeting dated
        16.03.2021 and to the clearance of the Excise Policy file on
        21.05.2021, which is described as having been processed with unusual
        haste. A meeting at Gauri Apartments on the same date is projected as
        part of the alleged plan to maximise profits.

   924.                     It is additionally alleged that he supported and secured
        the GoM recommendation in favour of M/S Indospirits and that he
        attended a meeting on 16.03.2021 at Taj Mahal Hotel, Delhi, along
        with other named individuals. The prosecution further states that he
        received excess credit notes amounting to ₹1.57 crores from A-9
        (Amandeep Singh Dhall). Lastly, it is alleged that upon withdrawal of
        the Excise Policy on 31.08.2022, an amount of about ₹60 crores
        remained outstanding in relation to the five retail zones under his
        control, out of which ₹46,88,78,307/- is stated to be unpaid, and that
        he was favoured by being permitted not to pay the said amount. These
        are the allegations as projected against A-23.


        Analysis

   925.                     This Court has failed to comprehend the basis on which
        A-23 has been arrayed as an accused. It is an admitted position that he
        was not part of any meeting at Gauri Apartments or at ITC Kohinoor,
        Hyderabad, both of which are projected by the prosecution as the most

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 446 of 549
        significant meetings where the alleged conspiracy and its modus
        operandi were crystallised.

   926.                     The only allegation sought to be attributed to him is his
        purported association with the episode concerning the 36-page
        printout, which is alleged to have been supplied to A-3, thereafter
        reaching A-8, and ultimately forming the Second GoM Report dated
        19.03.2021. This aspect has already been examined in detail,
        particularly in light of the statement of PW-71 and 72 the
        contemporaneous record, and it has been found that the said allegation
        does not withstand scrutiny.

   927.                     The Second GoM Report, on its plain terms,
        incorporated turnover clauses which, had they been reflected in the
        final Excise Policy, would have operated to the detriment of M/S
        Indospirit. Further, by prescribing an upper cap of 12% on the
        wholesale margin, the Second GoM Report removed the absence of a
        ceiling that existed in the earlier draft. The earlier position, where no
        upper cap was fixed, would, on the prosecution’s own theory, have
        been more advantageous to any wholesale entity seeking recoupment.
        The fixation of an upper limit, therefore, cannot logically be
        characterised as a measure favouring the so-called South Group.

   928.                     It is also not in dispute that A-23 is the only accused
        who had no interest whatsoever in the wholesale or manufacturing
        layer. In the absence of participation in the alleged foundational
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 447 of 549
        meetings, absence of demonstrated commercial stake in the wholesale
        structure, and in view of the infirmities surrounding the 36-page
        document theory, the basis for implicating A-23 remains wholly
        unclear on the material presently on record.

   929.                     The allegation concerning the CSR contribution of ₹80
        lakhs and the so-called “sham” land transaction of ₹14 crores has
        already been examined in detail. The material on record demonstrates
        that the land transaction was an independent contractual arrangement,
        executed as a distinct commercial engagement. There is nothing to
        indicate that it bore any nexus, direct or indirect, to the formulation or
        implementation of the Excise Policy, nor to the alleged mechanism of
        recoupment of the so-called “upfront amount.” The same conclusion
        applies to the CSR contribution. Both transactions were routed
        through regular banking channels, supported by documentation, and
        reflected in the financial records of the concerned entities. The
        prosecution has been unable to establish any linkage between these
        transactions and the alleged conspiracy.

   930.                     If these transactions are sought to be forcibly subsumed
        within the conspiracy narrative, the internal coherence of the
        prosecution’s theory stands undermined rather than strengthened. The
        prosecution has consistently projected recoupment as a structured
        recovery of profits through the wholesale layer. An independent land
        contract and a CSR contribution, transparently executed through

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 448 of 549
        banking channels, do not align with such a mechanism. To characterise
        them as conspiratorial acts would introduce inconsistency into the very
        architecture of the prosecution’s case.

   931.                     Equally significant is the complete absence of material
        demonstrating any benefit accruing to A-23 so as to justify his alleged
        participation in the conspiracy. He was not present at the meetings at
        Gauri Apartments or ITC Kohinoor, which are projected as the
        foundational stages of the alleged design. His non-participation in
        these critical meetings assumes relevance when the prosecution’s own
        case treats those meetings as decisive in shaping the modus operandi.

   932.                     The further allegation that A-23 was present at a meeting
        relating to the grant of distributorship by M/S PRI to M/S Indospirit
        does not advance the prosecution’s case. There is no material to
        suggest that A-23 had any direct or indirect interest in M/S Indospirit.
        He is not shown to have held any stake in the wholesale or
        manufacturing segment, nor is there any allegation that he received
        credit notes, profit transfers, or any other pecuniary advantage arising
        out of the distributorship arrangement. Mere presence at a business
        meeting, absent proof of stake, influence, or benefit, cannot substitute
        for evidence of conspiratorial participation.

   933.                     The issue of credit notes further accentuates the
        incongruity in the prosecution narrative. It has already been discussed
        that A-9 was not favourably disposed towards M/S Indospirit securing
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 449 of 549
        M/S PRI’s distributorship. If that be so, the suggestion that A-9 would
        then extend credit notes to entities allegedly controlled by A-23 runs
        contrary to commercial logic. A party dissatisfied with a
        distributorship outcome would scarcely incentivise the alleged
        beneficiary of that outcome. This internal contradiction strikes at the
        root of the theory that A-23 was positioned to receive or channel
        financial advantages arising from the wholesale structure.

   934.                     Viewed cumulatively, the absence of demonstrable
        benefit, the lack of participation in decisive meetings, the independent
        character of the CSR and land transactions, and the inherent
        contradictions surrounding the credit-note theory leave the allegation
        against A-23 resting on conjecture rather than cogent material.

   935.                     The allegation that A-23 Sarath Chandra Reddy
        impermissibly operated through “multiple entities” to secure retail
        licences proceeds on a fundamental misreading of Clause 4.1.2 (ii) of
        the Delhi DEP-21/22 and the concept of “related entities” embedded
        therein. Clause 4.1.2 (ii) does not prohibit participation by more than
        one company per se; it only restricts allotment of retail zones where
        entities are shown to be “related” within the meaning assigned by the
        Policy, namely by reference to shareholding, control, management, or
        beneficial ownership crossing the prescribed threshold. The mere fact
        that entities belong to a broader corporate group, or are commercially



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                    Page no. 450 of 549
        associated, does not ipso facto render them “related entities” for the
        purposes of disqualification or clubbing under the Policy.

   936.                     The prosecution has neither pleaded nor demonstrated,
        even prima facie, that the entities allegedly associated with A-23
        satisfied the Policy-defined criteria of relatedness so as to attract the
        embargo under Clause 4.1.2 (ii). There is no material placed on record
        establishing common shareholding beyond the prescribed limit,
        common            directors   exercising   controlling   influence,     or      any
        arrangement of beneficial ownership designed to defeat the policy cap.
        In the absence of such foundational facts, the allegation of misuse of
        multiple entities collapses into a bald assertion, unsupported by the
        statutory tests governing eligibility and disqualification.

   937.                     It is also material that the Excise Policy itself
        contemplated bidding by distinct legal persons, and the scrutiny of
        “related entities” was an institutional exercise entrusted to the Excise
        Department at the stage of tender evaluation. Once the competent
        authority accepted the bids and allotted retail zones after applying the
        Policy criteria, the prosecution cannot, by hindsight, recast lawful
        participation as criminal conduct without demonstrating fraud,
        suppression, or misrepresentation at the bidding stage. Criminal
        liability cannot be fastened merely because a commercial group
        lawfully succeeded in the tender process.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 451 of 549
   938.                     Viewed thus, the allegation that A-23 secured retail
        zones through “multiple entities” does not disclose any infraction of
        Clause 4.1.2 (ii) or the “related entity” clause under DEP-21/22.
        Absent          proof    of   policy-defined   relatedness   or       deliberate
        circumvention, the prosecution’s case on this aspect rests on
        assumption rather than statutory violation, and is insufficient to sustain
        a charge of conspiracy or undue benefit.

   939.                     Lastly, it is alleged that upon withdrawal of the Excise
        Policy on 31.08.2022, an amount of about ₹60 crores remained
        outstanding in relation to the five retail zones under his control, out of
        which ₹46,88,78,307/- is stated to be unpaid, and that he was favoured
        by being permitted not to discharge the said liability. This contention
        does not, on its face, sustain the allegation of conspiracy. The
        withdrawal of the policy was a subsequent administrative
        development. At the time when the alleged conspiracy is said to have
        been conceived or acted upon, there is nothing to indicate that any
        participant could have anticipated that the policy would be withdrawn
        on 31.08.2022. An uncertain future event cannot be treated as part of
        a prior criminal arrangement in the absence of clear material showing
        such foresight or design.

   940.                     It is also not shown that non-recovery of dues was
        confined to entities stated to be under the control of A-23. If
        outstanding amounts existed in respect of other retail licensees as well,

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                            Page no. 452 of 549
        the issue assumes the character of a commercial consequence
        following the discontinuance of the policy. In the absence of material
        demonstrating selective treatment or a prior understanding, the
        inference of favour remains unsubstantiated.

   941.                     There is no material to suggest that the alleged non-
        payment was conceived at the inception as a mechanism of
        recoupment. The prosecution’s theory of recoupment rests on distinct
        allegations and timelines. To equate subsequent outstanding dues with
        a pre-determined conspiratorial benefit would require specific
        evidence establishing such linkage, which is not forthcoming.

   942.                     At best, the matter appears to arise out of commercial
        transactions between wholesaler, manufacturer and retailer under a
        policy framework that was later withdrawn. Disputes relating to
        recovery of such dues ordinarily fall within the realm of contractual
        remedies. The fact that litigation has taken place between the parties
        further indicates the commercial nature of the controversy.

   943.                     Viewed thus, the allegation regarding outstanding dues
        does not, by itself, disclose any act in furtherance of a criminal
        conspiracy. The material relied upon by the prosecution is not
        sufficient to raise grave suspicion against A-23.

        Collapse of the Prosecution Case Alleging Policy Manipulation,
        Criminal Conspiracy, and Generation of Proceeds of Crime in the
        Form of Upfront Money:

   944.                     The very foundation of the prosecution case rests on the
        assertion that the formulation and implementation of the DEP-21/22
        were deliberately engineered to confer undue pecuniary advantage
        upon the so-called “South Group”. The alleged indicia of such design
        are projected to be the fixation of a 12% wholesaler margin, the
        stipulation of one manufacturer, one wholesaler, and the definition of
        “related entities”. On this premise, it is alleged that an up-front
        payment of ₹90–100 crores, purportedly quantified as 6% of
        anticipated profits, was agreed to and generated as illegal gratification,
        later stated to have been utilised for the Goa Assembly Election.

   945.                     As noticed and discussed in the preceding paragraphs,
        the record placed before the Court renders this narrative wholly
        unsustainable. It stands conclusively established that A-1 and A-2
        granted the L-1 licence to M/S Indospirits strictly in accordance with
        the notified eligibility criteria. The contemporaneous record discloses
        no deviation, indulgence, or extraneous consideration in the grant of
        such licence. Notably, the prosecution has failed to place on record
        any material whatsoever indicating either demand or receipt of illegal
        gratification by A-1 and A-2, or by any public servant, in connection
        with the said licensing process.

   946.                     Equally fragile is the allegation of manipulation in the
        framing of the DEP-21/22. The documentary trail demonstrates that
        the policy was formulated through the prescribed institutional route,
        in consonance with the Transaction of Business of the Government of
        NCT of Delhi Rules, the Allocation of Business Rules, and the Cabinet
        Secretariat Manual of Procedures. The prosecution has been unable to
        identify any unlawful intervention, surreptitious authorship, or
        distortion of the established decision-making process. In the absence
        of proof of policy manipulation, the very substratum on which the
        alleged conspiracy is sought to be erected stands demolished.

   947.                     Once the alleged foundational acts, policy manipulation
        and grant of licence for illegal consideration, are found to be devoid
        of evidentiary support, the superstructure of conspiracy necessarily
        collapses. The theory of generation of “proceeds of crime” is entirely
        derivative of these unsubstantiated premises. Where the genesis itself
        is missing, the question of accrual, layering, or utilisation of proceeds
        of crime does not arise. The chain of circumstances projected by the
        prosecution as forming an unbroken sequence of conspiracy does not
        merely suffer from missing links; it disintegrates altogether.

   948.                     What emerges instead is a troubling picture of an
        investigation steered by a preconceived outcome rather than by
        objective evaluation of evidence. Lawful administrative actions and
        policy decisions appear to have been selectively extracted, stripped of

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 455 of 549
        context, and artificially interlinked to manufacture an appearance of
        conspiracy. Such an approach reflects a marked departure from the
        settled principles governing fair investigation and betrays an effort to
        substitute inference and conjecture for proof.
                                                            (emphasis supplied)

   949.                     Nevertheless, even in the face of these fundamental
        infirmities, this Court does not consider it appropriate to leave any
        allegation unanswered or any issue unexamined. Conscious of its duty
        to subject every charge to judicial scrutiny, the Court shall, therefore,
        proceed further to examine the specific allegations relating to the
        accused persons who are stated to have utilised the alleged cash
        amounts in the Goa Assembly Election, so that the record may be
        tested comprehensively and no contention remains unaddressed.


        Allegation against A-12
   950.                          So far as A-12, Rajesh Joshi is concerned, the
        prosecution case, as projected in the Second Supplementary Charge-
        sheet, proceeds on the footing that he acted as a key Delhi-side
        conduit/handler in the alleged movement of cash stated to be part of
        the purported proceeds of crime, which cash is alleged to have been
        transported from Delhi to Goa for utilisation in connection with the
        Goa Assembly Elections, 2022. The prosecution does not project A-12
        as a recipient at Goa; rather, he is alleged to have operated at the

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 456 of 549
        source/dispatch end in Delhi, coordinating and arranging cash
        movement through angadiya channels.

   951.                     In particular, the prosecution attributes to A-12 a
        quantified linkage under the Asil Corporation channel (June–
        December 2021). It is alleged that A-12, jointly with A-13 (Damodar
        Prasad Sharma), arranged and provided cash aggregating to
        ₹11,93,30,000, which was allegedly handed over to Ashok Chandulal
        Shah (PW-183), proprietor of M/S Asil Corporation, for onward
        transfer to Goa through angadiya networks, since Asil Corporation
        allegedly had no Goa branch. The prosecution relies on PW-183 to
        attribute this Delhi-side source to A-12, and seeks to dovetail it with
        the angadiya delivery chain spoken to by PW-182 and PW-180, and
        with the Goa-side physical handover process described by PW-181,
        thereby projecting A-12 as the provider/dispatcher of the said cash
        segment.

   952.                     The prosecution further alleges that the cash, after being
        handed to PW-183, was routed through the angadiya network of M/S
        R. Kantilal Finance & Courier Services, and delivered at Goa during
        the period 21.06.2021 to 31.12.2021, with recipients named as
        Chanpreet Singh Rayat @ Preet (A-16), Rajiv Ashok Mondkar
        (PW-181) and Prince Kumar (A-14). In this structure, A-12 is alleged
        to be the person who arranged the cash at Delhi and caused its dispatch



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 457 of 549
        through intermediaries, with the delivery-side witnesses being relied
        upon to show transmission and receipt at Goa.

   953.                     Apart from the above quantified attribution, the
        prosecution case also projects A-12 as a person involved in the broader
        cash-transfer architecture, in the sense that he is alleged to have been
        in contact with intermediaries and angadiya operators involved in
        routing cash from Delhi through transit points to Goa. However,
        within the specific framework emerging from paras 16.14 to 16.23 (as
        relied upon), the quantified monetary attribution against A-12 remains
        centred on the ₹11,93,30,000 segment alleged to have been arranged
        and provided by him (with A-13) for onward angadiya transfer to
        Goa.

   954.                     Accordingly, the prosecution’s allegations against A-12
        Rajesh Joshi, as projected, are that he functioned as a Delhi-side
        organiser/provider/dispatcher of cash forming part of the alleged
        proceeds of crime, and that his role is sought to be established through
        the Asil Corporation → R. Kantilal route, culminating in delivery at
        Goa to the recipients named in the prosecution narrative.


        Allegations against A-13
   955.                     In so far as A-13, Damodar Prasad Sharma, is
        concerned, the prosecution case, as projected in the Second
        Supplementary Charge-sheet, is that he acted in close concert with
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 458 of 549
        A-12 (Rajesh Joshi) in facilitating and arranging the alleged
        movement of cash from Delhi to Goa through hawala/angadiya
        channels. The prosecution does not attribute to A-13 any role as a
        recipient of cash at Goa; rather, he is projected as operating at the Delhi
        end, assisting in the collection, arrangement and dispatch of cash
        which is alleged to form part of the proceeds of crime.

   956.                     The principal and quantified allegation against A-13
        arises under the Asil Corporation channel (June–December 2021). The
        prosecution alleges that A-13, acting as an employee/associate of
        A-12,        jointly     arranged   and   provided   cash   aggregating         to
        ₹11,93,30,000, which was allegedly handed over at Delhi to Ashok
        Chandulal Shah (PW-183), proprietor of M/S Asil Corporation, for
        onward transfer to Goa through angadiya networks. This attribution of
        source is founded almost entirely on the statement of PW-183, who
        states that “Shri Rajesh Joshi and his employee Shri Damodar” sent
        cash through M/S Asil Corporation from Delhi to Goa during the
        period July 2021 to December 2021.

   957.                     The prosecution further alleges that A-13 was in
        telephonic contact with angadiya operators and intermediaries
        involved in the routing of cash during the said period, and that he
        assisted A-12 in coordinating the logistics of dispatch. On this basis,
        A-13 is projected as having an active role in the arrangement and



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 459 of 549
        facilitation of the Delhi-side cash movement, though no independent
        handling, custody or receipt of cash by A-13 is alleged at Goa.

   958.                     According to the prosecution narrative, the cash
        allegedly arranged by A-13 (with A-12) was thereafter routed through
        M/S Asil Corporation and transmitted via the angadiya network of M/S
        R. Kantilal Finance & Courier Services, with delivery at Goa between
        21.06.2021 and 31.12.2021 to Chanpreet Singh Rayat @ Preet (A-16),
        Rajiv Ashok Mondkar (PW-181) and Prince Kumar (A-14). In this
        structure, A-13’s role is confined to the alleged Delhi-side facilitation
        and instruction, and the prosecution relies on delivery-side witnesses
        only to establish transmission and receipt at Goa.

   959.                     Beyond   the   aforesaid   quantified   segment,         the
        prosecution also seeks to portray A-13 as part of the broader alleged
        conspiracy to route cash through angadiya channels for political
        expenditure in Goa. However, within the specific factual framework
        emerging from paragraphs 16.14 to 16.23 of the Second
        Supplementary Charge-sheet, the only quantified monetary attribution
        against A-13 remains the ₹11,93,30,000 segment, alleged to have been
        jointly arranged and dispatched by him along with A-12.

   960.                     Accordingly, the allegations against A-13, Damodar
        Prasad Sharma, as recorded by the prosecution, are that he functioned
        as a Delhi-side facilitator and coordinator, acting in conjunction with
        A-12 in arranging and dispatching cash through the Asil Corporation
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 460 of 549
        angadiya route, culminating in alleged delivery at Goa to the recipients
        named in the prosecution narrative.



        Allegation against A-14

   961.                     In so far as A-14, Prince Kumar, is concerned, the
        prosecution case, as set out in the Second Supplementary Charge-
        sheet, projects him as a Goa-side recipient of cash, allegedly delivered
        through hawala/angadiya channels during the period June 2021 to
        December 2021. Unlike A-Nos. 12 and 13, Prince Kumar is not alleged
        to have operated at the Delhi end or to have arranged or dispatched
        cash; rather, his role is confined to the receipt of limited and
        specifically quantified amounts at Goa.

   962.                     The prosecution attributes to A-14 a specific and
        quantified sum of ₹16,08,000, allegedly received through hawala
        transactions on three occasions. As per paragraph 16.22 of the charge-
        sheet, the said amounts are stated to have been delivered as follows:
        ₹6,00,000 on 22.09.2021, ₹3,00,000 on 23.09.2021, and ₹7,08,000 on
        03.12.2021. These deliveries are sought to be established primarily
        through the delivery-side angadiya evidence of PW-180 (Sagar Kumar
        Patel), who claims to have effected delivery at Goa and to have
        recorded the same in his handwritten delivery records.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                    Page no. 461 of 549
   963.                     Apart from the aforesaid quantified amount, the
        prosecution further names Prince Kumar as one of the recipients
        within the broader June–December 2021 delivery segment
        aggregating to ₹11,93,30,000, which is alleged to have been routed
        through M/S Asil Corporation and thereafter through the angadiya
        network of M/S R. Kantilal Finance & Courier Services. However,
        beyond the sum of ₹16.08 lakhs, no additional specific or segregated
        quantum is attributed to Prince Kumar individually in the charge-
        sheet.

   964.                     The prosecution narrative places Prince Kumar (A-14)
        alongside Chanpreet Singh Rayat @ Preet (A-16) and Rajiv Ashok
        Mondkar (PW-181) as a recipient at Goa, relying upon the delivery-
        side statements to show that cash parcels were handed over at Goa
        through angadiya intermediaries. Prince Kumar is not alleged to have
        had any role in the sourcing of cash, the routing decisions, or the
        coordination of angadiya networks, nor is he alleged to have issued
        instructions to angadiya operators.

   965.                     Accordingly, the allegations against A-14, Prince
        Kumar, as projected by the prosecution, are limited in scope and
        nature. He is sought to be implicated as a recipient of relatively small,
        specifically quantified amounts of cash at Goa, allegedly delivered
        through hawala/angadiya channels, and as a named recipient within
        the larger June–December 2021 delivery segment, without any

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 462 of 549
        independent attribution of source-side activity, facilitation, or control
        over the alleged cash movement.



        Allegation against A-15

   966.                     In so far as A-15, Arvind Kumar Singh, is concerned, the
        prosecution case, as emerging from the Second Supplementary
        Charge-sheet, projects him as a Delhi-side financier and facilitator in
        respect of a distinct and isolated tranche of alleged cash movement
        during January 2022. Unlike A-12 and A-13, whose alleged roles are
        linked to the June–December 2021 period through the Asil
        Corporation channel, A-15 is not associated with that segment. His
        alleged involvement is confined to what the prosecution describes as
        the K.S. Enterprises channel.

   967.                   The prosecution alleges that during the period 04.01.2022
        to 10.01.2022, a sum of ₹7,10,92,500 was arranged at Delhi by A-15
        and thereafter routed to Goa through hawala/angadiya channels. The
        attribution of the Delhi-side source of this January 2022 tranche is
        founded exclusively on the statement of PW-183 (Ashok Chandulal
        Shah), who states that, apart from the Asil Corporation route, there
        existed a separate arrangement involving K.S. Enterprises, wherein
        cash was arranged at Delhi by Arvind Kumar Singh and routed through
        Devang Solanki. PW-183 places this arrangement squarely in the


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 463 of 549
        January 2022 period and does not state that the said cash passed
        through Asil Corporation.

   968.                     The prosecution further alleges that the cash so arranged
        was transmitted through the angadiya network of M/S R. Kantilal
        Finance & Courier Services. The delivery at Goa during January 2022
        is sought to be established through PW-180 (Sagar Kumar Patel), who
        states that he maintained handwritten delivery records and certifies
        that deliveries effected between 04.01.2022 and 10.01.2022
        aggregated to ₹7,10,92,500, applying the convention of adding three
        zeros to the figures recorded. PW-180 identifies Chanpreet Singh
        Rayat @ Preet (A-16) as the recipient of these January 2022 deliveries.
        However, PW-180 does not depose to the source of the funds, nor does
        he attribute any instruction or role to A-15 (Arvind Kumar Singh) or
        Devang Solanki.

   969.                     The prosecution also relies upon PW-192, PW-193 and
        PW-194 to corroborate the delivery mechanism through the R.
        Kantilal angadiya system. These witnesses speak to the routing of cash
        through angadiya channels and the procedure of delivery at Goa,
        including the use of token or note numbers. None of these witnesses,
        however, attributes the source or funding of the January 2022 tranche
        to A-15, and their statements are confined to the factum of routing and
        delivery through angadiya intermediaries.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 464 of 549
   970.                     It is thus the prosecution’s case that A-15, acted as a
        Delhi-side funder/conduit for the January 2022 tranche of
        ₹7,10,92,500, which is alleged to have been routed through Devang
        Solanki of K.S. Enterprises and delivered at Goa to Chanpreet Singh
        Rayat @ Preet through the angadiya network of M/S R. Kantilal. No
        allegation is made that A-15 received any cash at Goa, or that he was
        involved in the earlier June–December 2021 segments. His alleged
        role, as projected by the prosecution, is thus confined to the funding
        and facilitation of the January 2022 cash movement, as recorded in
        paragraphs 16.14, 16.22 and 16.23 of the Second Supplementary
        Charge-sheet.



        Allegation against A-16

   971.                     In so far as A-16, Chanpreet Singh Rayat @ Preet, is
        concerned, the prosecution case, as projected in the Second
        Supplementary Charge-sheet, places him at the centre of the alleged
        cash-movement narrative and portrays him as the principal and
        ultimate recipient of cash at Goa. The prosecution alleges that A-16
        received substantial amounts of cash routed from Delhi through
        hawala/angadiya channels during the period June 2021 to January
        2022, and that such cash constituted part of the alleged proceeds of
        crime utilised in connection with the Goa Assembly Elections, 2022.


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 465 of 549
   972.                     According to the prosecution, the alleged receipt of cash
        by A-16 spans multiple segments and channels. It is alleged that during
        the period 21.06.2021 to 10.01.2022, cash aggregating to ₹44.54
        crores was delivered to A-16 at Goa through different angadiya routes.
        This aggregate figure is arrived at by combining several sub-segments
        of alleged delivery. The prosecution asserts that a sum of
        ₹17,38,14,500 was directly delivered at Goa through M/S R. Kantilal
        Finance & Courier Services, with PW-180 (Sagar Kumar Patel) acting
        as the delivery conduit. In addition, a further sum of ₹27 crores is
        alleged to have been collected by PW-181 (Rajiv Ashok Mondkar)
        from the angadiya network and thereafter handed over to A-16 at
        Goa.

   973.                  The prosecution further alleges that A-16 was a recipient
        within        the        June–December   2021    segment    aggregating          to
        ₹11,93,30,000, which is stated to have been routed from Delhi through
        M/S Asil Corporation and thereafter transmitted via the angadiya
        network of M/S R. Kantilal Finance & Courier Services. Under this
        segment, A-16 is named alongside Rajiv Ashok Mondkar and Prince
        Kumar (A-14) as recipients at Goa. The Delhi-side sourcing of this
        segment is attributed by the prosecution to Accused Nos. 12 and 13,
        while A-16 is projected as the Goa-side recipient.

   974.                      A further and distinct allegation relates to the January
        2022 tranche. The prosecution alleges that during the period

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 466 of 549
        04.01.2022 to 10.01.2022, a sum of ₹7,10,92,500 was delivered at Goa
        to A-16 through the angadiya network of M/S R. Kantilal. This tranche
        is stated to have been funded at Delhi by A-15 (Arvind Kumar Singh)
        and routed through Devang Solanki of K.S. Enterprises, with A-16
        being identified as the ultimate recipient at Goa.

   975.                     In addition to the above, the prosecution also names
        A-16 as a recipient in the third chain involving routing through
        multiple Delhi-based angadiyas via a freelance angadiya. Under this
        chain, cash aggregating to ₹25.50 crores is alleged to have been routed
        through Kirtikumar Ambalal Angadiya, Maa Ambey Angadiya and
        Nilkanth Enterprise, coordinated by PW-189 (Chandra Kumar Tripathi
        @ Chandan), and thereafter delivered at Goa through the R. Kantilal
        network, with A-16 and PW-181 (Rajiv Ashok Mondkar) named as
        recipients.

   976.                   The prosecution further alleges that A-16 exercised control
        over the logistics of receipt at Goa. Reliance is placed on the statement
        of PW-181, who states that on multiple occasions during November–
        December 2021, he collected sealed box parcels containing cash from
        PW-180 (Sagar Kumar Patel) at Goa and handed over the same to A-16
        at locations directed by him. On this basis, the prosecution projects
        A-16 not merely as a passive recipient, but as a person who directed
        the collection and handover of cash at Goa.

   977.                Accordingly, the allegations against A-16, Chanpreet Singh
        Rayat @ Preet, as projected by the prosecution, are that he functioned
        as the principal Goa-side recipient and handler of cash, allegedly
        routed from Delhi through multiple hawala/angadiya channels during
        June 2021 to January 2022, aggregating to ₹44.54 crores, and that such
        cash was received and utilised under his directions as part of the
        alleged proceeds of crime connected with the Goa Assembly Elections,
        2022.



        Allegation against A-21

   978.                 It is the prosecution case that A-21 Vinod Chauhan acted as
        a key conduit in the alleged criminal conspiracy relating to the Delhi
        DEP-21/22, particularly in the transfer and routing of alleged proceeds
        of crime from Delhi to Goa for utilisation in the Goa Assembly
        Elections 2022. It is alleged that A-21 maintained close association
        with senior functionaries of AAP, including accused Arvind Kejriwal
        and accused Manish Sisodia, and that this association is reflected from
        digital evidence recovered during investigation.

   979.                 According to the prosecution, data extracted from the Apple
        iPhone of A-21 Vinod Chauhan revealed WhatsApp chats with a
        mobile number saved under the contact name “HCM AK”, stated to be
        used by A-18 (Arvind Kejriwal). It is alleged that multiple mobile


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 468 of 549
        numbers attributed to A-18 (Arvind Kejriwal), as well as contact
        details of A-8 (Manish Sisodia) and other AAP functionaries, were
        found saved in the phone of A-21. It is further alleged that images of
        WhatsApp chats relating to arranging meetings with senior leaders,
        birthday wishes, and other communications were retrieved from the
        device.

   980.                    It is the prosecution case that PW-195 Ashok Kaushik,
        former Personal Assistant to A-17 (Ms. K. Kavitha), alleged during
        investigation that on two occasions he handed over bags containing
        cash to accused Vinod Chauhan on the instructions of A-4 (Abhishek
        Boinpally). It is alleged that the cash was delivered in bags at the
        places directed and was received by A-21 (Vinod Chauhan), forming
        part of the alleged transfer of proceeds of crime in connection with the
        Excise Policy conspiracy.


   981.                   The prosecution further alleges that images of GC Notes of
        ₹10 denomination were recovered from the mobile phone of A-21, and
        that the serial numbers of these notes corresponded with those
        allegedly used in hawala transactions involving transfer of about ₹18
        crores to A-16 (Chanpreet Singh Rayat) and Rajiv Ashok Mondkar. It
        is also alleged that screenshots containing serial numbers of ₹10
        currency notes received from the mobile phone of A-16 were found
        stored in the device of A-21 Vinod Chauhan.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 469 of 549
   982.                     On the basis of the aforesaid material, the prosecution
        alleges that A-21 Vinod Chauhan acted on behalf of A-18 Arvind
        Kejriwal and AAP as a conduit for transferring alleged ill-gotten
        money generated from the Excise Policy conspiracy to Goa through
        hawala channels. It is alleged that the cash so transferred was utilised
        by A-16 Chanpreet Singh Rayat for making payments in cash to
        vendors, assembly managers, booth in-charges, volunteers and other
        persons engaged by AAP for the Goa Assembly Elections 2021–22.



        Allegation against A-22

   983.                     It is the prosecution case that A-22 Ashish Chand
        Mathur acted in close coordination with A-21 Vinod Chauhan in the
        alleged transfer and routing of proceeds of crime arising out of the
        Excise Policy conspiracy. It is alleged that A-22 functioned as an
        intermediary and facilitator in the hawala/angadiya network used for
        moving cash from Delhi to Goa.

   984.                     According to the prosecution, A-22 Ashish Chand
        Mathur was associated with Delhi-based angadiya operators and
        freelance angadiyas, including Chandan Kumar Tripathi @ Chandan,
        through whom large amounts of cash were allegedly routed to Goa. It
        is alleged that A-22 provided cash to such angadiyas for onward



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 470 of 549
        transmission through hawala channels to recipients in Goa, including
        A-16 Chanpreet Singh Rayat and Rajiv Ashok Mondkar.

   985.                     The prosecution further alleges that call detail records
        and digital evidence establish telephonic contact between A-22 Ashish
        Chand Mathur and various persons involved in the alleged cash
        movement, including angadiya operators and other co-accused. It is
        alleged that A-22 acted in coordination with A-21 Vinod Chauhan and
        accused Vinod Chauhan’s network to ensure delivery of cash amounts
        forming part of the alleged ₹25.50 crores routed to Goa.

   986.                     It is alleged that the role of A-22 Ashish Chand Mathur
        was not independent but was integrally connected with the activities
        of A-21 Vinod Chauhan, and that together they acted as conduits for
        transferring alleged illicit funds to Goa for use in election-related
        expenditure of AAP during the Goa Assembly Elections 2022.


        Analysis

        (i) Chain 1. M/S Ashil corporation

   987.                     PW-182, Shri Ashokbhai Prahladbhai Shah, who was
        working as the Manager at the CG Road Branch of M/S R. Kantilal
        Finance and Courier Service, Ahmedabad, has stated that he was the
        person responsible for making and maintaining the entries relating to
        cash transactions at the said branch. He states that the documents


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 471 of 549
        seized by the investigating agency pertain to routine Angadiya
        transactions recorded during the normal course of business. PW-182
        further clarifies that the entries relating to cash transferred to Goa were
        communicated by him to PW-180 (Sagar Patel), who was managing
        the Goa operations, for onward delivery.

   988.                     The statement of PW-182 clearly indicates that the
        Ahmedabad branch acted only as an intermediate transit point. The
        cash was received at Ahmedabad from third parties and thereafter
        transferred to the Goa branch of M/S R. Kantilal Finance and Courier
        Service for delivery to the end recipient, as per the instructions
        received.

   989.                     PW-183, Shri Ashokbhai Chandulal Shah, the proprietor
        of M/S Ashil Corporation and a freelance Angadiya operator, explains
        the source and movement of this cash. He states that he facilitated the
        transfer of cash amounts on the instructions of Rajesh Joshi (A-12)
        and his employee Damodar (A-15). According to PW-183, the money
        was first handed over to Angadiya firms at Delhi, then routed through
        Ahmedabad or Mumbai, and finally delivered at Goa through M/S R.
        Kantilal Finance and Courier Service. He categorically states that
        during the period July 2021 to September 2021, cash aggregating to
        approximately ₹5–7 crores was transferred to Goa in several instances,
        and that one additional transfer of ₹5 crores was effected at the end of
        December 2021.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 472 of 549
   990.                     PW-183 further clarifies that the December 2021
        transfer of ₹5 crores was over and above the earlier transfers made
        during July–September 2021. He states that the recipient at Goa for
        these transfers was “Preet” during the earlier period, and “Rajiv” in
        the December 2021 transaction. He also admits that his role was
        confined to arranging and facilitating the transfer through Angadiya
        networks and receiving confirmation of delivery; he does not state that
        he personally counted, verified, or physically handled the cash at the
        destination point.

   991.                     Read conjointly, the statements of PW-182 and PW-183
        bring out a simple picture:

        (i) the cash originated from Delhi-based persons (identified by
        PW-183 as Shri Rajesh Joshi and Shri Damodar), (ii) it was routed
        through Angadiya firms operating at Delhi, Ahmedabad and/or
        Mumbai,

        (iii) the Ahmedabad branch of M/S R. Kantilal Finance functioned
        only as a transit node, and (iv) the deliveries at Goa took place over a
        defined period, namely July 2021 to September 2021, with one
        additional instance in December 2021, aggregating to approximately
        ₹10 crores in total, as per PW-183’s own estimation.

   992.                     On a conjoint reading of the statements, the prosecution
        version regarding the movement of cash may be depicted in a clear
        and sequential manner as under:

                          • “Rajiv” – during December 2021
                                  (examined as PW-181)




CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 474 of 549
   993.                     As per the prosecution witnesses themselves, the alleged
        cash originated from Rajesh Joshi and Damodar Sharma (A-12 and
        A-13) at Delhi. The said cash was first entrusted to PW-183
        (Ashokbhai Chandulal Shah), who functioned as an Angadiya through
        M/S Ashil Corporation. From there, the cash was routed to the
        Ahmedabad branch of M/S R. Kantilal Finance & Courier Service,
        where PW-182, as Branch Manager, maintained the accounts and
        facilitated onward transmission.

   994.                     Thereafter, the cash was sent to the Goa branch of M/S
        R. Kantilal Finance & Courier Service, which was managed by
        PW-180 (Sagar Patel). The final delivery at Goa, as per the prosecution
        case, was made to “Preet” (alleged A-16) during the period July to
        September 2021, and to “Rajiv” in December 2021, the latter having
        been examined as PW-181.

   995.                     Thus, the prosecution’s own version delineates a linear
        Angadiya chain involving multiple intermediaries across Delhi →
        Ahmedabad → Goa, with each witness attributing to himself a limited,
        facilitative role confined to routing and delivery, without any assertion
        of personal verification, counting, or independent knowledge of the
        contents of the cash parcels at the point of final delivery.


        (ii) Chain-2 (K.S. Enterprises) attributed to A-15



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 475 of 549
   996.                     In Chain-2, the prosecution seeks to attribute a cash
        amount of ₹7,10,00,000/- to A-15. The foundation of this allegation
        rests primarily on the statements of PW-191, Shri Devang Dhirubhai
        Solanki, stated to be in charge of the Delhi office of K.S. Enterprises,
        whose statement under Section 161 of Cr.P.C. was recorded on
        08.05.2023, followed by his statement under Section 164 of Cr.P.C. on
        18.05.2023 (D-239). PW-191 alleges that A-15 handed over cash to
        him on five to six occasions, which was thereafter delivered at Goa
        through M/S R. Kantilal & Sons to A-16.

   997.                     To lend support to this allegation, the prosecution relies
        upon the statement of PW-180, Shri Sagar Patel, Manager of the Goa
        office of M/S R. Kantilal Finance and Courier Service. PW-180
        translates certain handwritten pauti records and asserts that the figures
        recorded therein are truncated and that the actual amount delivered is
        to be ascertained by adding three zeroes to the figures mentioned.

   998.                     It appears that the entries translated by PW-180 in his
        statement, existing at Serial Nos. 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21, pertain to the
        period 04.01.2022 to 10.01.2022, with the amounts written as ₹9,900,
        ₹9,950, ₹13,432, ₹29,850 and ₹7,960, which, upon application of the
        witness’s own method, translate to ₹99,00,000/-, ₹99,50,000/-,
        ₹1,34,32,000/-, ₹2,98,50,000/- and ₹79,60,000/- respectively. On the


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 476 of 549
        prosecution’s showing, these entries are sought to be treated as
        reflecting deliveries at Goa in early January 2022.


        (iii) Chain-3:Cash Transfer through Delhi-based Angadias via
        Freelance Angadia PW-189 (Chandan Kumar Tripathi)

   999.                     Sub-Chain (A): Alleged Transfer of ₹3.50 Crores
        (28.09.2021–29.09.2021) PW-189 (Sarvesh Kumar Yadav) states that
        on 28.09.2021, a sum of ₹1,50,000/- was collected from Ashish
        Mathur at an office situated opposite Lodhi Hotel, Delhi Jal Board
        premises, and on 29.09.2021, a further sum of ₹2,crores was collected
        from C-97, First Floor, Defence Colony, New Delhi. According to
        PW-189 the said amounts were collected jointly by him and PW-190 ,
        transported in multiple instalments of approximately ₹50 lakhs per
        trip, and handed over in Delhi to Hashmukh Bhai of M/S Kirti Kumar
        Amba Lal Angadia Firm, Chandni Chowk. PW-189 further states that
        token/note numbers and the mobile number of the intended recipient
        were provided, and that his role ended with the delivery of cash to the
        Angadia firm in Delhi. PW-189, in material conformity with PW-190
        to this extent, also refers to the collection of an aggregate amount of
        ₹3.50 crores on 28.09.2021 and 29.09.2021 and its transfer from Delhi
        to Goa through Angadia channels.

   1000.                    However, PW-189 introduces additional elements not
        stated by PW-190, namely that the cash was transferred through M/S
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                    Page no. 477 of 549
        Maa Ambe Angadia, and that the delivery at Goa was effected through
        M/S Kantilal Courier Service, managed by Sagar, to Preet, whom the
        prosecution seeks to project as A-16. Thus, while PW-190’s statement
        is confined to collection in Delhi and handover to Hashmukh Bhai of
        M/S Kirti Kumar Amba Lal, PW-189 extends the chain beyond Delhi
        by asserting delivery at Goa, naming the courier firm and the recipient.
        PW-190 does not speak of M/S Maa Ambe, M/S Kantilal Courier
        Service, Sagar, or Preet, nor does he claim any knowledge of the Goa-
        end delivery.


   1001.                    Sub-Chain (B): Alleged Transfer of ₹22 Crores
        (Undated / Cumulative) In the concluding portion of his statement,
        PW-189 alone states that, apart from the ₹3.50 crores, he facilitated
        the transfer of a further sum aggregating to ₹22 crores from Delhi to
        Goa. He states that this amount was routed through multiple Delhi-
        based Angadia firms, namely M/S Kirti Amba (Hashmukh Bhai), M/S
        Maa Ambe (Jagat Bhai), and M/S Neel Kant (Vishal Bhai). According
        to PW-189, this amount was delivered at Goa through M/S Kantilal
        Courier Service, managed by Sagar, to Rajeev, and the prosecution
        seeks to attribute such receipt to Rajeev acting on behalf of A-16.
        PW-190, however, is completely silent on any such transfer of ₹22
        crores. He does not refer to any collection, transportation, handover,
        Angadia routing, or delivery, whether in Delhi or Goa, of this amount.


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                    Page no. 478 of 549
        No date-wise breakup, source-wise attribution, or mode of collection
        of the alleged ₹22 crores finds mention in the statement of PW-190.

        (iv) Angadia “Pauti” Documents (D-Series) Tested on the Touchstone
        of V.C. Shukla (supra) (Jain Hawala Case)

   1002.                    A careful examination of the prosecution’s own
        documentary index and witness disclosures reveals that the Angadia
        evidence relied upon in the present Excise Policy case rests entirely

   1005.                    What unmistakably emerges is that the prosecution itself
        characterises the Angadia “pauti” material as loose, detachable, pencil-
        written sheets, often partly blank, with no witness asserting that these
        papers formed part of any bound, paginated or regularly maintained
        ledger kept in the ordinary course of Angadia business.

   1006.                    This factual position brings the Angadia “pauti” material
        into direct and unavoidable comparison with the documentary
        foundation examined by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in V.C. Shukla
        (supra). In that case, searches at the premises of J.K. Jain yielded
        diaries, notebooks and loose sheets containing alleged coded entries
        of receipts and payments. The Supreme Court recorded that the entire
        edifice of the prosecution case rested on those diaries and loose papers,
        and proceeded to test their admissibility and evidentiary value under
        Section 34 of the Evidence Act. The Court authoritatively has observed
        that: “...Book’ ordinarily means a collection of sheets of paper or other
        material… fastened or bound together so as to form a material
        whole. Loose sheets or scraps of paper cannot be termed as ‘book’ for
        they can be easily detached and replaced….”.

   1007.                    Applying this test, it was categorically concluded that
        loose sheets could not be treated as books of account at all. Even in
        respect of spiral notebooks which were treated as “books”, the Court
        sounded a further and decisive caution:



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 487 of 549
                “...From a plain reading of the Section it is manifest that…
                even if the above requirements are fulfilled and the entry
                becomes admissible as relevant evidence, still, the statement
                made therein shall not alone be sufficient evidence to charge
                any person with liability….”.
   1008.                    The rationale for this statutory limitation was explained
        in words of enduring relevance:

                “...Since… an element of self-interest and partisanship of the
                entrant… cannot be ruled out, the additional safeguard of
                insistence upon other independent evidence… has been
                provided for in Section 34 by incorporating the words ‘such
                statements shall not alone be sufficient to charge any person
                with liability’…”.
   1009.                    Ultimately, while dealing with allegations against Shri
        L.K. Advani and Shri V.C. Shukla, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held:

                “…..A conspectus of the above decisions makes it evident
                that even correct and authentic entries in books of account
                cannot without independent evidence of their trustworthiness,
                fix a liability upon a person….Keeping in view the above
                principles… those entries would not be sufficient to charge
                Shri Advani and Shri Shukla… for there is not an iota of
                independent evidence in support thereof….”.
   1010.                    When these settled principles are applied to the Angadia
        “pauti” material in the present case, the infirmity becomes even more
        pronounced. Unlike the Jain Hawala matter, where at least some spiral
        notebooks were treated as “books”, the D-series documents here are
        overwhelmingly loose sheets, photocopies, or isolated register pages,
        written in pencil, with no proof of regular maintenance in the course
        of business. Their detachable, incomplete and informal nature renders

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 488 of 549
        them inherently vulnerable to interpolation and manipulation, and
        wholly unreliable as legal evidence.
                                                               (emphasis supplied)

   1011.                    Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that such
        “pauti” entries could be looked at for a collateral purpose, V.C.
        Shukla (supra) decisively holds that entries by themselves, howsoever
        voluminous, cannot fasten criminal liability without independent
        corroboration. No such independent evidence, whether by way of
        lawful recovery from the accused, admissible banking or financial
        trail, contemporaneous electronic records, or proof of demand,
        acceptance or conscious possession, has been placed on record in
        support of the Angadia notings.

   1012.                    Moreover, it is of decisive importance to note that the
        statements of the Angadia witnesses are not independent or self-
        contained narratives of any transaction. Their depositions are
        admittedly founded upon and derived from the so-called “pauti”
        entries. Once these entries are held to be legally inadmissible, or are
        otherwise denuded of probative value in light of the settled principles
        laid down in V.C. Shukla (supra), the testimonial edifice erected upon
        them cannot be sustained. The witnesses merely seek to explain or
        interpret the pauti notings; they do not depose to any contemporaneous
        act of payment, receipt, delivery, or conscious handling of cash by the
        accused, independent of those writings.

   1013.                    The Angadia witnesses, inter alia PW-180, PW-186,
        PW-189, PW-191 and allied witnesses, are not neutral observers. By
        their own showing, they are persons allegedly involved in the very
        mechanism through which cash is claimed to have been transported or
        handled. While their statements seek to exonerate themselves by
        asserting absence of participation in any conspiracy or lack of
        knowledge regarding the origin of the cash amounts, the same
        statements nonetheless bring them within the legal contours of
        abetment. For understanding the scope of the expression “aid”
        occurring in the third clause of Section 107 IPC, reference may be
        made to Explanation 2 thereto, which reads as under:

                “….Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission
                of an act, does anything in order to facilitate the commission of
                that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said
                to aid the doing of that act….”.
   1014.                    Tested on this statutory explanation, the role attributed to
        the Angadia witnesses, as emerging from their own depositions,
        renders their statement accomplice-like in character. In criminal
        jurisprudence, such evidence is inherently suspect and cannot, in law,
        form the sole basis of criminal liability without strict and independent
        corroboration. A witness cannot be permitted to corroborate his own
        legally infirm document, nor can mere repetition of such statements
        elevate them to the status of independent proof. As has been discussed
        on multiple occasions, the statement of one accomplice cannot serve


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                            Page no. 490 of 549
        to corroborate the statement of another accomplice. In other words,
        accomplice evidence cannot be mutually corroborative in law.
        Reliance is placed upon the judgments of Hon’ble Supreme Court in
        K. Hashim (supra), Somasundaram (supra), Laxmipat Choraria
        (supra) and A.R. Antulay (supra).

   1015.                    This position stands squarely supported by V.C. Shukla
        (supra), wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court rejected the prosecution’s
        attempt to utilise statements of certain alleged recipients to validate
        diary entries against others, holding that such statements could, at best,
        establish reliability of the entries qua the maker or recipient alone, and
        not operate as independent corroboration against third parties.

   1016.                    Consequently, the alleged “chain of payment” sought to
        be projected by the prosecution is rendered wholly speculative. With
        the foundational pauti entries excluded from consideration, the
        purported links in the chain remain suspended in mid-air, without any
        legally admissible anchor at either end. There is no lawful recovery,
        no contemporaneous banking or financial trail and no proof of
        demand, acceptance, or conscious possession of the alleged proceeds
        of crime.

   1017.                    The prosecution’s case, in substance, rests primarily and
        substantially on the pauti entries to demonstrate the movement of
        money in cash, characterised as “proceeds of crime”. Once those
        entries fail the test of admissibility and evidentiary reliability, the
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 491 of 549
        entire narrative of cash movement collapses. What remains are
        allegations unsupported by legally sustainable material, denuded of
        continuity, corroboration, or evidentiary linkage.

   1018.                    Accordingly, this Court is constrained to observe that the
        prosecution has failed to cross the basic evidentiary threshold required
        even at the stage of framing of charge. Treating the Angadia witnesses
        as accomplice-like witnesses, and applying the settled principles
        reiterated in V.C. Shukla (supra), the absence of independent
        corroboration proves fatal. The narrative of cash movement and
        alleged proceeds of crime, once stripped of its inadmissible
        foundation, collapses in its entirety, leaving the allegations bereft of
        substance, continuity, or prima facie legal support.

        (v) Appreication of Statement of PW-180 (Angadiya Records and
        Cash-Delivery Entries)
   1019.                    Admittedly, PW-180, Patel Sagar Kumar, was the
        Manager of the Goa office of M/S Kantilal Finance and Courier
        Service, an Angadia firm which, as per the prosecution’s own case,
        was the only such firm operating at Goa during the relevant period. It
        is the prosecution’s categorical stand that the so-called pauti entries
        spoken to by PW-180 constitute the pivotal material relied upon to
        bridge and complete the alleged chain of delivery of cash at the Goa
        end.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 492 of 549
   1020.                    In this backdrop, the statement of PW-180 assumes a
        position of central importance. The pauti entries relied upon are not
        peripheral or corroborative in nature; rather, they are projected as the
        primary basis to establish both the factum of delivery and the alleged
        receipt of cash. Consequently, the figures recorded therein, the manner
        in which such figures are sought to be interpreted, and the method
        adopted to arrive at the alleged quantum of money received and
        disbursed cannot be accepted at face value. They necessarily warrant
        close and careful scrutiny, particularly in the absence of
        contemporaneous, systematically maintained records or independent
        corroboration.           Any   inconsistency,   exaggeration,   or      internal
        incongruity in the quantification of amounts would, therefore, strike at
        the very foundation of the prosecution’s alleged money-movement
        chain.

   1021.                    PW-180 an Angadiya associated with M/S Kantibhai
        (Kantilal) Finance and Courier Service, is projected by the prosecution
        as the author of certain handwritten “pauti” records seized during an
        Income-Tax raid at the premises of the said entity in Goa. The witness
        states that these records were prepared by him in Gujarati, in the
        regular course of business, and that the entries reflected cash receipts
        and deliveries effected through the Angadiya channel.

   1022.                    According to PW-180, the cash amounts noted in the
        pauti were received at Goa by one “Preet”, described as a Sardar, and

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 493 of 549
        one “Prince”. The prosecution seeks to identify “Preet” as A-16 and
        “Prince” as A-14. On the basis of the said pauti, the prosecution
        alleges, in cumulative terms, that A-16 ultimately received cash
        aggregating to about ₹44.5 crores in Goa, and that A-14 received
        certain amounts in three transactions.

   1023.                    PW-180 further explains a crucial feature of the record-
        keeping practice followed by the Angadiya establishment. He
        categorically states that the figures written in the column titled
        “Amount” do not represent the full cash amount, and that the actual
        figure transferred is to be obtained by adding three zeroes to the figure
        mentioned. At the last para PW-180 categorically states that “ the
        actual figure transferred can be obtained by adding three zeroes in the
        finger mentioned in coloumn titled amount. It is in practice that we do
        not write last three zeroes of the actual amount transferred in our
        records. In case the amount dealt do not contain zero in last three
        places than we write the full amount and put a stroke before digit at
        hundreds place”. He clarifies that, as a matter of practice, the last three
        zeroes of the actual amount are not written; where the amount does not
        end with three zeroes, the full amount is written with a stroke before
        the digit at the hundreds place. This explanation is expressly recorded
        by the witness in the concluding portion of his statement.

   1024.                    Applying the witness’s own explanation, and translating
        the pauti entries accordingly, the amounts allegedly received by

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 494 of 549
        “Preet” (attributed to A-16) are reflected in Serial Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
        7, 8, 9 and 11 to 21 of the table relied upon by PW-180. The amounts
        attributed to “Prince” (alleged to be A-14) are reflected at Serial Nos.
        10, 11 and 16.

   1025.                    For clarity, and strictly on the basis of PW-180’s own
        statement that three zeroes are to be added, the translated chart may be

        aggregate, a sum of ₹17,54,22,500/- was delivered to “Preet, Preeti
        and Prince” at Goa, and a further sum of ₹27,00,00,000/- was
        delivered to one “Raju/Rajiv” at Goa. On this basis, the prosecution

        relating to Raju/Rajiv, alleged to have been collected on behalf of
        A-16), the aggregate figure attributable to A-16 works out as under:

               Heading ‘C’ (Raju/Rajiv): ₹27,00,00,000/-

               Total Aggregate: ₹1,04,11,10,000/- (approximately ₹104.11
                crores).

   1029.                    This cumulative figure, arrived at strictly by applying
        PW-180’s own stated method of adding three zeroes to the amounts
        mentioned in the pauti, stands in stark and irreconcilable contrast to
        the prosecution’s projected figure of approximately ₹44.5 crores
        allegedly received by A-16. The magnitude of this divergence
        underscores that the prosecution’s computation is not borne out by the
        internal arithmetic of the very documents and statement on which
        reliance is placed.

   1030.                    When the entries are accepted as explained by PW-180
        himself, and the amounts are mechanically recalculated by adding
        three zeroes to the figures written in the pauti, the resultant totals travel
        far beyond the figures selectively projected by the prosecution. The
        internal arithmetic emerging from the witness’s own method does not
        align with the prosecution’s stated aggregates, either qua A-16 or qua
        A-14.

   1031.                    This   figure   stands   in   stark   and   irreconcilable
        contradiction to the prosecution’s projected figure of approximately
        ₹44.5 crores allegedly received by A-16. The incongruity is not
        marginal but fundamental, and flows directly from the witness’s own
        explanation of the accounting practice.

   1032.                    Thus, when the statement of PW-180 is read as a whole,
        and applied in the manner expressly stated by him, the prosecution’s
        numerical conclusions are shown to be the result of selective

        extraction and truncation of the very records relied upon. The
        statement of PW-181 does not cure this defect, as he nowhere asserts
        having verified, opened, or counted the cash allegedly delivered. Read
        conjointly, the statements of PW-180 and PW-181 render the
        prosecution theory on quantum not merely doubtful but internally
        inconsistent at the threshold stage, undermining the reliability of the
        figures sought to be projected against the accused.

   1033.                    This incongruity assumes significance at the threshold
        stage, as it demonstrates that the prosecution’s numerical conclusions
        are not a natural or inevitable consequence of PW-180’s statement, but
        depend upon selective extraction and truncation of the very records on
        which reliance is placed.

   1034.                    Thus, when the statement of PW-180 is read as a whole,
        and applied in the manner expressly stated by him, the prosecution’s
        numerical conclusions are shown to be the result of selective
        extraction and truncation of the very records relied upon. The
        statement of PW-181 does not cure this defect, as he nowhere asserts
        having verified, opened, or counted the cash allegedly delivered. Read
        conjointly, the statements of PW-180 and PW-181 render the
        prosecution theory on quantum not merely doubtful but internally
        inconsistent at the threshold stage, undermining the reliability of the
        figures sought to be projected against the accused.

   1035.                    It emerges as an admitted position from the record that
        A-12, A-13, A-14, 15, 16, 21 and 22 were not participants in any
        meeting, discussion or interaction in which the alleged conspiracy to
        manipulate the DEP-21/22 is claimed to have been conceived,
        deliberated upon or executed. Equally, there is no material to suggest
        that either these accused or M/S Chariot Productions Media Pvt. Ltd.,
        APPL and IANPL had any direct or indirect engagement with any
        wholesaler or retail licensee operating under the DEP-21/22. In the
        absence of any policy-side linkage, participation or nexus, the
        prosecution’s case necessarily shifts away from acts of manipulation
        and rests entirely on a theory of alleged “knowledge”, namely, that the
        funds utilised during the Goa election campaign were purportedly
        “proceeds of crime”.

   1036.                    It is also not in dispute that M/S Chariot Productions
        Media Pvt. Ltd. undertook campaign-related work for the Aam Aadmi
        Party in Goa. The prosecution itself relies upon the statement of
        PW-91 and places on record multiple release orders, work instructions
        and execution of campaign activities. The case, therefore, is not
        founded on an allegation of fictitious or non-existent work, nor does
        the prosecution advance a case of a sham or shell entity floated to
        camouflage transactions. The gravamen of the allegation is confined
        to the asserted mode and manner of expenditure, rather than the
        absence of any underlying campaign activity.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 500 of 549
   1037.                    The prosecution seeks to bridge this gap primarily
        through angadiya witnesses, loose slips, private notings and allied
        materials, supplemented by call detail records. In law, however, such
        material does not, by its mere existence, establish either the source and
        taint of the funds, the requisite knowledge on the part of the accused,
        or any agreement or common design constituting a criminal
        conspiracy. As settled in V.C. Shukla (supra), loose sheets and private
        records maintained in the course of business do not acquire the status
        of substantive evidence merely because they are seized and produced.
        Further, angadiya witnesses, who admittedly speak to sustained cash
        movement through informal channels, bear an accomplice-like
        character, and their statement, as a matter of prudence, requires
        independent corroboration on material particulars, which is
        conspicuously absent on the present record. Reliance is again placed
        upon the judgments of Hon’ble Supreme Court in K. Hashim (supra),
        Somasundaram (supra), Laxmipat Choraria (supra) and A.R. Antulay
        (supra).

   1038.                    Call detail records and evidence of physical presence, at
        best, establish contact or connectivity. They do not disclose the content
        of the communication or the purpose of the interaction. Absent
        admissible and reliable material of the criminal context or subject
        matter of such calls or meetings, mere telephonic contact or presence
        cannot be elevated into “grave suspicion” of conspiracy or imputed

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 501 of 549
        knowledge of alleged proceeds of crime. To do so would be to
        substitute conjecture for proof, and inference for evidence, a course
        impermissible even at the threshold stage of consideration.

   1039.                    On a cumulative appreciation of (i) the prosecution’s
        own structuring of the three chains; (ii) the admitted position of no
        policy-side nexus qua A-12, A-15, A-16,A-21 and A-22; (iii) the
        prosecution’s reliance on loose sheets/private angadiya records and
        accomplice-like versions; and (iv) the binding controls in Laxmipat
        Choraria (supra), A.R. Antulay (supra) and V.C. Shukla (supra), this
        Court finds that the prosecution has not supplied the legally required
        bridges of proof to sustain, even at the threshold, the allegation of
        conspiracy or conscious handling of proceeds of crime against A-12,
        A-13, A-14, A-15, A-16, A-21 and A-22.

   1040.                    The prosecution material, at its highest, demonstrates a
        narrative of alleged cash routing/delivery within the angadiya
        ecosystem. It does not, on legally admissible and independently
        corroborated material, establish (a) the criminal provenance of the
        cash as “proceeds of crime” of an excise-policy conspiracy; (b)
        knowledge or reason to believe in that provenance; or (c) a meeting of
        minds amounting to criminal conspiracy. The deficiencies are not
        minor “missing links”; they go to the root, because the prosecution’s
        edifice seeks to derive guilt from inadmissible/private records,



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 502 of 549
        uncorroborated accomplice-like statement, and neutral technical data,
        an approach expressly cautioned against in V.C. Shukla (supra).

        Foundational Issues Requiring Consideration                   Before        Final
        Determination at the Stage of Order on Charge
   1041.                    Upon a holistic consideration of the entire record,
        including the material placed by the prosecution, the rival submissions
        addressed, and the analysis undertaken by this Court, it becomes
        necessary, before proceeding to the final determination at the stage of
        order on charge, to foreground certain foundational aspects of the case.
        The present matter does not involve a conventional allegation of
        bribery founded upon a direct quid pro quo between a bribe giver and
        a bribe taker. Instead, the prosecution advances a far more expansive
        narrative, alleging impropriety in the formulation of a public policy
        and seeking to implicate, in one broad sweep, public servants,
        members of the political executive, private businessmen, political
        party functionaries, and even party volunteers.

   1042.                    In doing so, the prosecution narrative travels beyond the
        traditional contours of corruption jurisprudence and enters the
        sensitive constitutional terrain of the electoral process itself, by
        attempting to link the alleged policy formulation with expenditure
        stated to have been incurred during a State election. Such an approach,
        by its very nature, raises issues of grave constitutional and institutional
        consequence, as it risks casting a generalized cloud of criminal


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 503 of 549
        suspicion over the electoral process as a whole, rather than confining
        scrutiny to clearly identifiable acts constituting defined criminal
        offences.

   1043.                    It is against this backdrop that this Court considers it
        imperative to pause and examine certain fundamental questions before
        recording its final view on the issue of framing of charge. The breadth
        of the allegations, the spectrum of actors sought to be drawn within
        the prosecutorial net, and the manner in which electoral expenditure
        and political activity are sought to be subsumed within the criminal
        domain call for careful and principled scrutiny. These issues cannot be
        approached mechanically or in isolation; they demand a calibrated
        assessment, mindful of the settled limits of criminal law, the
        constitutional framework governing policy formulation and elections,
        and the degree of legal suspicion required at the stage of charge.

   1044.                    It is clarified that the issues discussed hereafter are not
        being taken as factors that have weighed with the Court while
        examining the material placed by the investigating agency. The record
        has been assessed strictly on the basis of the settled principles
        applicable at this stage, and the conclusion rests on that independent
        evaluation.

   1045.                    These issues were raised by the defence during the
        course of hearing. Since the submissions on behalf of the State have
        already been dealt with in detail, it is only appropriate to briefly deal
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 504 of 549
        with these aspects as well. They are being noted to ensure that the
        discussion is complete. In a matter involving an extensive record and
        lengthy arguments, it would not be proper to leave such issues
        unaddressed. The ultimate conclusion is not dependent upon these
        aspects. They are mentioned only so that the consideration of the case
        remains full and balanced.

        (i) Intrusion into the Election Expenditure Domain — Separation of
        Powers and Electoral Federalism.
   1046.                    At the threshold, this Court considers it imperative to
        underscore that the constitutional scheme governing elections in India
        is consciously structured to insulate the electoral process from
        executive or investigative intrusion, save in strictly defined and
        constitutionally sanctioned circumstances. Article 324 of the
        Constitution of India vests in the Election Commission of India (ECI)
        the plenary power of superintendence, direction and control over
        elections, not as a matter of administrative convenience, but as a core
        constitutional safeguard designed to preserve the purity, neutrality, and
        credibility of the democratic process. This entrustment assumes
        heightened significance in the context of election campaigns, where
        allegations and counter-allegations of financial impropriety are an
        inevitable by-product of political contestation. The Constitution, fully
        cognisant of this reality, deliberately places such disputes within the
        supervisory competence of an independent constitutional authority,
        rather than the executive or its investigative arms.
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 505 of 549
   1047.                    The Representation of the People Act, 1951 reinforces
        this constitutional design by constituting a complete and self-
        contained code in respect of election expenditure. Sections 77 and 78
        regulate the incurring and accounting of expenditure; Section 10A
        prescribes disqualification for failure to lodge a true and correct
        account; and Section 123(6) treats expenditure in excess of prescribed
        limits as a corrupt practice, remediable exclusively through an election
        petition under Sections 80 and 100 of the Act. The statutory
        architecture leaves no ambiguity: alleged breaches of expenditure
        norms are, in the first instance, electoral wrongs, not criminal offences,
        and are to be scrutinised by the Election Commission and adjudicated
        by the High Court exercising election jurisdiction.

   1048.                    The Act does not envisage, indeed, it consciously
        excludes, the routine or unilateral invocation of criminal machinery at
        the behest of rival political actors. This demarcation serves a
        foundational democratic purpose. If investigative agencies such as the
        CBI or enforcement authorities under the Prevention of Money
        Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) were permitted to enter the electoral
        arena merely on allegations of “cash spending”, “illegal funding”, or
        “unaccounted expenditure”, the inevitable consequence would be the
        criminalisation of electoral competition. Such an approach would arm
        the executive with coercive instruments capable of influencing



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 506 of 549
        political outcomes, thereby eroding the level playing field that lies at
        the heart of free and fair elections.

   1049.                    When such allegations are sought to be re-characterised
        or “dressed up” as CBI cases or PMLA proceedings, an additional and
        more serious constitutional concern arises. The CBI has no inherent
        jurisdiction to investigate any offence; its authority flows solely from
        the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, and may be
        exercised only upon State consent, Central Government notification,
        or a specific judicial direction, as authoritatively held by the
        Constitution Bench in State of West Bengal v. Committee for
        Protection of Democratic Rights, (2010) 3 SCC 571. Election-funding
        disputes, absent disclosure of a distinct and independent penal offence,
        do not automatically satisfy this jurisdictional threshold.

   1050.                    To permit the CBI to independently assume jurisdiction
        over election-expenditure allegations would amount to the executive
        arrogating to itself a supervisory role over elections, a role which the
        Constitution has consciously and expressly denied to it. The position
        is no different, and indeed more restrictive, under the PMLA. The
        statute cannot be set in motion in a vacuum. It is predicated on the
        prior existence of a scheduled offence and the generation of “proceeds
        of crime” therefrom. Allegations of excess election expenditure, cash
        usage, or undeclared campaign spending do not, by themselves,
        constitute scheduled offences under the PMLA. It abundantly clear

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 507 of 549
        that allegations of “hawala” or cash transactions, unaccompanied by
        independent, legally admissible evidence establishing the illegality of
        the source and its nexus with a defined offence, cannot sustain criminal
        prosecution. {Reliance is placed upon V.C. Shukla (supra)}.

   1051.                    This Court must also emphasise the rule of law
        dimension inherent in this constitutional arrangement. The rule of law
        demands that each constitutional actor operate within its assigned
        sphere. The Election Commission, as a constitutionally created and
        insulated body, is entrusted with maintaining electoral discipline and
        fairness. Investigative agencies, which form part of the executive,
        cannot be permitted to displace or supplant this constitutional
        authority by assuming functions that the Constitution has reserved for
        the ECI and the election courts. Any such substitution would not
        merely be irregular; it would represent a fundamental distortion of
        constitutional           governance,   undermining   both     democratic
        accountability and institutional balance. This Court therefore observes
        that Article 324 entrusts the Election Commission with the discretion
        to determine whether and when any matter warrants reference to
        investigative agencies. It is only upon such constitutionally anchored
        scrutiny, where material discloses a clear, standalone criminal offence,
        independent of election-law violations, that involvement of agencies
        like the CBI or the Enforcement Directorate may be contemplated. To
        permit investigative agencies to act independently, without such

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 508 of 549
        referral or without disclosure of a legally cognisable scheduled
        offence, would be to invert the constitutional hierarchy, reducing the
        Election Commission to a peripheral observer in a domain where it is
        meant to be supreme.
                                                              (emphasis supplied)

   1052.                    Accordingly, this Court holds that investigations by the
        State police, the CBI, or the Enforcement Directorate cannot be
        initiated or sustained solely on allegations of election-funding
        irregularities and excess expenditure. The exclusive prerogative to
        examine such allegations, at least at the threshold, lies with the
        Election Commission of India, and the statutory remedy of an election
        petition under the Representation of the People Act, 1951 remains the
        primary judicial avenue for adjudication. Criminal law, and
        particularly the extraordinary and coercive regimes of the PC Act and
        the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, cannot be employed as a
        substitute for election-law remedies, nor as a device to convert
        political accusations into prosecutable offences, unless a clear,
        independent, and cognisable criminal offence, wholly distinct from
        election-law violations, is prima facie disclosed in accordance with
        law. Any attempt to do otherwise would strike at the very core of
        constitutional democracy, erode the rule of law, and imperil the
        neutrality and fairness of the electoral process itself.

        (ii) Policy Deviation or Commercial Advantage, Without Proof of
        Mens Rea or Quid Pro Quo, Does Not Give Rise to Criminal
        Liability:
   1053.                    The issue that falls for consideration is whether an
        individual or a company alleged to have engaged in cartel-like conduct
        or practices said to result in monopolisation-acts asserted to run
        contrary to the objectives of the DEP-21/22-can, on that foundation
        alone, be exposed to criminal prosecution. The answer must be in the
        negative. A deviation from policy intent, or the securing of a
        commercial advantage within the contours of the policy framework,
        does not, by itself, attract criminal liability. Prosecution under the IPC,
        the PC Act, or any other penal statute requires the presence of specific
        acts satisfying the statutory ingredients of an offence. The
        consequences flowing from such conduct ordinarily lie in the
        regulatory and administrative sphere. These may include cancellation
        or suspension of licences, withdrawal of policy-based privileges,
        imposition of penalties, or recovery of undue gains realised contrary
        to the terms of the licence or the policy. These are matters governed
        by administrative and contractual principles regulating the relationship
        between the State and the licensee, and not by the criminal law.

   1054.                    Experience shows that whenever the Government
        revisits or restructures a regulatory regime, particularly in sectors
        moving towards public-private participation or increased private
        involvement, industry participants may seek to take advantage of

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 510 of 549
        perceived gaps or flexibilities in the policy. Even if such attempts
        appear commercially opportunistic, they do not, without more, amount
        to criminality. Criminal culpability can arise only where the material
        discloses clear elements of fraud, forgery, bribery, quid pro quo,
        misappropriation, collusive abuse of official position, or any other act
        squarely covered by a penal provision. In BALCO Employees’ Union
        v. Union of India, (2002) 2 SCC 333, the Supreme Court emphasised
        that economic decisions taken by the Government, even when they
        benefit private entities or lead to concentration of economic power,
        cannot invite criminal consequences unless mala fides or statutory
        breach is demonstrated.

   1055.                    Mere financial loss to the State or commercial gain to a
        private party does not furnish a basis for criminal prosecution in the
        absence of evidence of corruption or unlawful enrichment. Even if a
        policy does not yield the desired outcome or because a private
        participant secures an advantage from operating within the policy
        framework.

   1056.                    The threshold for invoking criminal jurisdiction remains
        the existence of a culpable act that falls within the four corners of a
        penal statute; anything short of that is a matter for administrative
        regulation and not criminal adjudication.

        (iii) Policy Formulation, Reform, and the Limits of Criminal
        Prosecution

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 511 of 549
   1057.                    The formulation, modification, or substitution of a
        public policy falls exclusively within the constitutional prerogative of
        the elected Legislature and the Executive. It is for these branches of
        Government to undertake an assessment of the prevailing
        circumstances, to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of the existing
        regime, to examine the lacunae that may have surfaced over time, and
        to determine whether a shift in policy is warranted in the larger interest
        of governance. Any such policy, whether newly introduced or revised,
        is subject to scrutiny in the democratic forums of Parliament or the
        State Legislature, where its objectives, effectiveness, advantages,
        limitations, and economic implications are debated and evaluated.
        These are the proper constitutional fora to decide whether a policy
        meets the socio-economic needs of a rapidly developing nation.

   1058.                    When matters squarely falling within this domain are
        thereafter viewed through a preconceived prism of conspiracy or
        presumed criminal intent, merely because complaints are drafted in a
        manner that casts aspersions on the new framework, often at the behest
        of those who had benefitted from the flaws of the earlier regime, it
        inevitably hampers the legitimate functioning of the State. Such an
        approach deters reform and discourages innovation in governance. A
        developing economy cannot afford a situation where bona fide policy
        choices are second-guessed as criminal ventures in the absence of any



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 512 of 549
        statutory foundation or material demonstrating the essential
        ingredients of an offence.

   1059.                    Investigating agencies are not vested with, nor can they
        assume, the role of evaluating the economic wisdom, administrative
        soundness, or policy rationale of decisions taken by the competent
        executive authorities. Their statutory mandate is confined to
        investigating offences defined by law; it does not extend to examining
        whether a policy should or should not have been adopted. The
        initiation of criminal proceedings merely because a policy may have
        conferred incidental commercial advantage upon a private entity
        would amount to an impermissible conflation of policy outcomes with
        criminal culpability. Treating every consequence of a policy as
        potential evidence of wrongdoing not only distorts the legal
        framework but also threatens to paralyse the very process of
        governance. Such an approach creates an environment of
        apprehension among officials who act in good faith and in accordance
        with established procedure under the directions of the political
        executive.


   1060.                    Public administration cannot function in an atmosphere
        where officials are perpetually exposed to the risk of criminal
        prosecution for decisions taken within the authority of law, particularly
        when no element of mens rea or abuse of office is discernible. It is

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 513 of 549
        essential for a developing nation that officers are afforded freedom
        from unwarranted harassment so that they may perform their duties
        with confidence and without fear. In the larger constitutional scheme,
        policymaking must remain insulated from investigative overreach.
        The criminal law cannot be invoked to substitute legislative debate,
        nor can it be converted into a tool to challenge the efficacy or
        correctness of policy. {Reliance is placed upon the judgment of
        Hon’ble Supreme Court in BALCO Employees’ Union (supra)}.
        Stability, certainty, and an assurance that honest administrative
        decisions will not be retrospectively subjected to criminal scrutiny are
        indispensable to the advancement of national development and the
        faithful implementation of executive decisions.

        FINAL OUTCOME AFTER EVALUATION

   1061.                    Upon examining the investigation in its sequential
        progression, this Court finds that the overall direction adopted by the
        investigating agency gives rise to a serious and legitimate concern
        touching upon the fundamentals of the rule of law and constitutional
        governance.

   1062.                    The investigation does not commence with the
        identification of essential ingredients to attract criminal offence, nor
        with the collection of legally admissible material demonstrating
        criminality in the formulation or execution of the DEP-21/22. Instead,


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                    Page no. 514 of 549
        the investigation appears to alter its focus mid-course and proceeds in
        an ever-expanding sweep, seemingly driven by the question of who all
        can be brought within its fold. The investigative trail begins with a
        campaign-related company, then moves through small vendors and
        intermediaries, thereafter to angadiyas who admittedly operate
        organised cash-transfer networks, followed by house owners, hotel
        operators, political volunteers, contesting candidates, State-level
        office-bearers, and ultimately the national leadership. This widening
        arc does not appear to be founded on fresh or independent
        incriminating material emerging at each stage, but rather on a
        preconceived assumption of the existence of “proceeds of crime”,
        coupled with an apparent attempt to demonstrate that no segment has
        been left untouched in the purported effort to trace such proceeds.

   1063.                    A particularly troubling feature of this approach is the
        manner in which angadiyas are dealt with. Individuals who openly
        acknowledge operating systematic cash-movement syndicates are not
        proceeded against as accused, but are instead converted into
        prosecution witnesses. Their largely uncorroborated and self-serving
        statements are then employed to implicate persons placed
        progressively higher in the alleged chain. Such selective attribution of
        culpability inevitably weakens the evidentiary foundation and
        indicates an investigation structured to sustain a predetermined



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 515 of 549
        narrative rather than one guided by impartial and objective fact-
        finding.

   1064.                    More fundamentally, the investigation strays into the
        constitutionally demarcated domain of election expenditure. By
        scrutinising campaign logistics, accommodation arrangements,
        political volunteers, and alleged cash payments, the investigating
        agency, in substance, undertakes a self-conducted audit of election
        spending. This field falls within the exclusive constitutional
        jurisdiction of the Election Commission of India. The assumption of
        such a role by an investigating agency amounts to an exercise of power
        not vested in it by law and runs contrary to the carefully balanced
        constitutional framework.

   1065.                    The implications of this approach are not merely legal,
        but constitutional in character. The rule of law requires that criminal
        investigation be anchored to clearly defined offences, follow a legally
        sanctioned sequence, and remain confined within jurisdictional limits.
        Constitutionalism demands that investigative power be exercised with
        restraint, sensitivity, and respect for institutional boundaries. An
        investigative environment that generates fear, where scrutiny travels
        indiscriminately from contesting candidates to small vendors who
        merely provide logistical support during elections, risks chilling
        legitimate political participation. In such an atmosphere of pervasive



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 516 of 549
        apprehension, the foundational guarantee of free and fair elections
        stands imperilled.

   1066.                    The concern, therefore, is not with isolated investigative
        acts, but with a methodology that reverses the settled legal sequence,
        blurs constitutional boundaries, and risks converting criminal
        investigation into an instrument of overreach. Acceptance of such an
        approach would undermine the discipline of criminal law, erode
        constitutional safeguards, and strike at the very foundations of
        democratic governance.

   1067.                    This Court considers it necessary to record that the
        present matter has posed an exceptional degree of difficulty in the
        formation of a prima facie opinion for the limited purpose of
        considering the framing of charge. Ordinarily, it is expected that upon
        examining the statements of a few material witnesses, some indicative
        circumstance may surface which, when taken at face value, could lend
        support to the allegations set up by the prosecution. Guided by that
        expectation, the Court undertook a sequential appraisal of the
        statements. However, it soon became apparent that no such material
        emerged at any intermediate stage, compelling the Court to undertake
        a comprehensive examination of the statement of each witness until
        the very last. What stands out on such scrutiny is the conspicuous
        absence of any fact or circumstance which could legitimately give rise
        to even a foundational suspicion, much less a prima facie inference, of

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 517 of 549
        the commission of the offences imputed to the accused persons. The
        investigation, as reflected in the charge-sheet and the accompanying
        documents, has not succeeded in disclosing a chain of events which
        satisfies even the minimal threshold required under law for proceeding
        to frame a charge. To the contrary, the contemporaneous record,
        including the movement of files, the notings recorded at various levels,
        and the manner in which the Technical Evaluation Committee
        discharged its functions, demonstrates that the formulation of the
        DEP-21/22 was undertaken through the established administrative
        channels and in furtherance of the objectives expressly set out
        therein.

   1068.                    The documentation reveals due adherence to the
        procedural safeguards and institutional checks embedded in the
        Transaction of Business framework, leaving no room to infer any
        clandestine departure from the prescribed process. In these
        circumstances, and having regard to the settled position that the Court
        at this stage must ascertain whether the material placed on record, if
        unrebutted, would constitute the ingredients of the alleged offences, it
        becomes evident that the present record falls substantially short of that
        requirement.

   1069.                    The   criminal   process   undoubtedly   vests        wide
        discretionary powers in the investigating agency, including the
        authority to array a person as an accused, to tender pardon and

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 518 of 549
        examine an accused as an approver, or, in appropriate cases, to
        examine a person merely as a witness. These powers are recognised as
        legitimate procedural instruments intended to facilitate effective
        investigation and assist the Court in its truth-finding function. Their
        conferment, however, does not place them beyond the controlling
        disciplines          of   fairness,   proportionality,   reasonableness         and
        constitutional conscience. At the core of criminal investigation lies a
        delicate equilibrium between investigative efficiency and substantive
        justice, and the power to transform an accused into an approver is a
        carefully circumscribed exception to the ordinary rule of prosecution,
        justified only as a means to secure truthful disclosure of otherwise
        concealed facts. When exercised mechanically, selectively or with an
        oblique purpose, this power ceases to operate as an aid to justice and
        instead undermines both the fairness of the process and the credibility
        of the outcome.

   1070.                    A grave concern arises when a person who appears, on a
        prima facie appraisal, to be a principal or first-degree participant in the
        alleged offence is granted pardon and projected as an approver. The
        jurisprudential rationale underlying the approver mechanism is that a
        participant of comparatively lesser culpability may be pardoned to
        expose graver criminality. If this logic is inverted, by insulating one of
        the alleged architects or central actors of the offence and proceeding
        against others primarily on the strength of his statement, the

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 519 of 549
        investigative process itself becomes inherently suspect. In the present
        case, PW-20, approver Dinesh Arora, is projected as a key conspirator,
        allegedly involved not merely in facilitation but even in execution of
        the alleged offence, rendering the selection of an approver vulnerable
        to serious scrutiny. Justice is not served when culpability is re-
        engineered to suit investigative convenience rather than determined on
        the basis of objective truth.

   1071.                    This concern is structurally aggravated by the incentives
        inherent in approver status. A person tendered pardon does so with a
        legitimate expectation of immunity and personal liberty. When such
        expectation is reinforced by non-opposition to bail or conduct
        suggestive of assured leniency, the approver’s statement inevitably
        falls under a cloud of suspicion. The risk of conscious or subconscious
        tailoring of the narrative to align with the prosecution theory is not
        speculative but intrinsic to the very nature of the bargain. In such
        circumstances, the approver risks degenerating from a source of truth
        into a conduit for the investigative narrative.

   1072.                    The statutory and regulatory framework reinforces this
        caution. Section 306(4) of CrPC embodies a clear legislative intent
        that an approver, until examined as a witness, should ordinarily remain
        in judicial custody. This requirement is not punitive but prophylactic,
        intended to insulate the approver from external influence, prevent
        tutoring or inducement, and preserve the spontaneity and authenticity

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 520 of 549
        of disclosure. This safeguard is mirrored and strengthened by Rules 5
        and 8 of Chapter 14 of the Delhi High Court Rules and Orders. Rule 5
        recognises that the statement of an approver, being that of an
        accomplice, is prima facie of a tainted character and cannot be acted
        upon unless corroborated in material particulars, the nature and extent
        of such corroboration depending upon factors such as the nature of the
        crime, the character of the approver’s evidence and the degree of his
        complicity. Rule 8 operates as the procedural complement by
        mandating that an approver, after acceptance of pardon, should be kept
        in judicial custody until the termination of the trial, thereby
        safeguarding the conditions under which such statement is tendered.

   1073.                    This dual safeguard stands authoritatively affirmed by
        the Supreme Court in Suresh Chandra Bahri v. State of Bihar (1995
        Supp (1) SCC), wherein it was categorically held that keeping an
        approver in custody is founded on statutory principles of public policy
        and public interest, the violation of which cannot be tolerated. While
        the Court clarified that an erroneous release of an approver on bail
        may not invalidate a pardon once validly granted, it simultaneously
        underscored that such deviation directly impinges upon the credibility
        and       evidentiary     worth   of   the   approver’s   statement.       Read
        harmoniously, therefore, Rule 5 and Rule 8 function in tandem: Rule
        5 governs the weight that approver statement may carry by insisting
        on independent corroboration on material particulars, while Rule 8

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 521 of 549
        governs the conditions under which such statement is to be given, so
        as to prevent contamination at its source.

   1074.                    Contemporary investigative realities further weaken any
        justification for disproportionate reliance on approver statement.
        Before elevating a co-accused to the status of an approver,
        investigative fairness demands that his version be subjected to
        rigorous preliminary scrutiny against such independent material.
        Scientific and psychological tools such as polygraphic and lie
        detection test, when employed strictly within constitutionally
        permissible and legally regulated bounds, may serve as ancillary aids
        in assessing whether the disclosure is prima facie truthful or merely
        self-serving.

                                                               (emphasis supplied)

   1075.                    Procedural   fairness   also   demands     institutional
        symmetry: if a person’s statement is sufficient to treat him as an
        accused, the converse decision to pardon him must be supported by
        demonstrable reasons grounded in relative culpability and evidentiary
        necessity. The differential treatment of PW-125 (Magunta Srinivasan
        Reddy) and PW-126 (Raghav Magunta Reddy), coupled with non-
        opposition to bail, illustrates how selective indulgence, unsupported
        by a reasoned distinction in role or responsibility, erodes public
        confidence in the fairness of the criminal process.


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 522 of 549
   1076.                    Ultimately, criminal investigation is not a competitive
        exercise aimed at securing convictions at any cost. It is a
        constitutionally informed, truth-seeking function governed by the rule
        of law. The approver mechanism, when misapplied, carries the grave
        risk of shielding the guilty while imperilling the innocent. Any
        departure from the twin disciplines of substantive corroboration and
        procedural custody undermines the integrity of the approver
        mechanism and substantially weakens the probative value of such
        statement, even at the threshold stage of consideration of charge. In
        the long run, adherence to procedural fairness is not an impediment to
        effective investigation; it is the sole assurance that the criminal process
        will culminate in justice that is real, credible and enduring.

        ORDER
   1077.                    Upon an exhaustive and painstaking examination of the
        entire record, undertaken over a period exceeding two months,
        encompassing voluminous documentary material and the depositions
        of nearly three hundred prosecution witnesses, and after affording full
        opportunity of hearing to the parties, this Court is left in no manner of
        doubt that the prosecution case does not disclose even the threshold of
        a prima facie suspicion, far less the “grave suspicion” mandated by
        settled principles of criminal jurisprudence for proceeding further. The
        Excise Policy case, as sought to be projected by the CBI, is wholly


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 523 of 549
        unable to survive judicial scrutiny and stands discredited in its entirety.
        While it is to the credit of the investigating agency that it has placed
        reliance upon the statement of its own witnesses even when such
        evidence runs contrary to the prosecution’s foundational allegations,
        the cumulative effect of that very evidence demolishes, rather than
        supports, the case sought to be built. To compel the accused to face the
        rigours of a full-fledged criminal trial in the stark absence of any
        legally admissible material connecting them to the alleged offences
        would not serve the ends of justice; it would instead constitute a
        manifest miscarriage of justice and an abuse of the criminal process,
        offending the most basic tenets of fairness and the rule of law.

   1078.                    The alleged conspiracy, from its very inception, has
        progressively unravelled and, upon close scrutiny, is revealed to be
        nothing more than a speculative construct resting on conjecture and
        surmise, devoid of any admissible evidence. The investigation, when
        tested against the material collected by the agency itself, reflects a
        fundamental failure to properly appreciate, evaluate, or draw lawful
        inferences from the evidence and documents on record. As a result, the
        prosecution case is rendered legally infirm, unsustainable, and unfit to
        proceed any further in law. Stated differently, this Court records that
        the theory of an overarching conspiracy, so emphatically projected,
        stands completely dismantled when tested against the evidentiary
        record.

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 524 of 549
   1079.                    Upon consideration of the entire material placed on
        record, this Court is of the considered view that the prosecution has
        failed to place any material which, even prima facie, suggests that the
        DEP-21/22 was manipulated, altered, or engineered to confer any
        undue or unlawful benefit upon any private individual or the so-
        called “South Group”. On the contrary, the contemporaneous record
        clearly establishes that the policy was the outcome of a consultative
        and deliberative exercise, undertaken after engagement with relevant
        stakeholders and in adherence to the procedure prescribed under law.
        Though there was no statutory or constitutional requirement
        mandating the obtaining of suggestions from the Hon’ble Lieutenant
        Governor, the file notings unmistakably reflect that such suggestions
        were nevertheless sought, examined, and incorporated. The procedural
        integrity of the policy-making process thus stands affirmed from the
        documentary record itself.

                                                              (emphasis supplied)

   1080.                    Once the formulation of the policy is shown to be the
        product of deliberation, institutional scrutiny, and procedural
        compliance, any subsequent attempt to attribute criminality to its
        implementation becomes wholly untenable. The very foundation on
        which the prosecution seeks to construct the narrative of conspiracy,
        centred around alleged payment of “upfront money” and its purported
        recoupment, stands fundamentally eroded. In the absence of a tainted

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 525 of 549
        policy or demonstrably unlawful implementation, the prosecution
        theory is reduced to conjecture. Private persons who sought to derive
        commercial advantage from a policy validly framed and lawfully
        implemented, without any established violation of policy conditions
        or statutory prohibitions, cannot be compelled to face the rigours of
        criminal prosecution. This Court finds no apparent breach of
        restrictions relating to “related entities” or any other policy condition
        which could, by itself, attract criminal liability.

   1081.                    The allegations concerning payment of upfront money
        and its alleged recoupment are equally devoid of legal substratum. De
        hors any material indicating manipulation in policy formulation or
        corruption in implementation, such allegations fail to sustain. Even
        otherwise, upon independent scrutiny, this Court finds that the entire
        alleged chain of payments rests predominantly on so-called pauti
        entries of Angadia firms, documents which are inadmissible in law,
        and on approver-like statement which remains uncorroborated on
        material particulars. These infirmities are not peripheral; they strike at
        the very root of the prosecution case and render it unsustainable even
        at the threshold stage.

   1082.                    At this stage, it must be emphasised that however
        elaborate the investigative exercise may be, and however carefully the
        narrative is sought to be constructed, the discipline imposed by the
        Indian Evidence Act cannot be diluted or deferred merely because

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                      Page no. 526 of 549
        the matter is at the stage of charge. The principles embodied in the
        Evidence Act are time-tested safeguards evolved through long-settled
        jurisprudence, designed to assist courts in discovering the truth and
        testing the authenticity of allegations even at the preliminary stage. In
        the present case, these principles have operated as the governing
        framework. When the material relied upon by the prosecution is tested
        on the touchstone of admissibility, relevance, and probative value, the
        appearance of a coherent conspiracy dissolves, exposing the
        allegations to be founded on inadmissible material and post-facto
        reconstruction.

   1083.                    A cumulative appraisal of the record further reveals an
        investigative approach marked by an attempt to stitch together
        disparate fragments so as to create an impression of a vast and complex
        conspiracy, unsupported by legally admissible material. The
        investigation appears to have proceeded on a predetermined trajectory,
        implicating virtually every person associated with the formulation or
        implementation of the policy in order to lend an illusion of depth and
        credibility to an otherwise fragile narrative. The endeavour to further
        connect such allegations to the Goa Assembly elections, so as to
        project, layering, and utilisation of alleged proceeds of crime, rests
        more on inference and assumption than on legally sustainable
        material.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 527 of 549
   1084.                    The settled principles of evidence law exist precisely to
        ensure that criminal liability is founded on legally admissible material
        capable of giving rise to a sustainable inference, and not on conjecture,
        or investigative imagination. When the material on record is examined
        on this time-honoured touchstone, the prosecution case fails to
        disclose even a prima facie case, far less the grave suspicion required
        at the stage of framing of charge. The prosecution has thus failed to
        cross the minimum threshold mandated by law.

   1085.                    In view of the foregoing discussion and the reasons
        recorded hereinabove, this Court has no hesitation in holding that the
        material placed on record does not disclose even a prima facie case,
        much less any grave suspicion, against any of the accused persons.
        Accordingly, Accused Nos. A-1 to A-23 are discharged of all the
        offences alleged against them in the present case.

        Issues Warranting Judicial Notice Despite Discharge of the Accused
        Persons

   1086.                    Notwithstanding the discharge of all the accused
        persons, the record still reflects certain matters of concern which ought
        not to remain unnoticed. Recently, in Dr. Anand Rai v. State of Madhya
        Pradesh and Another, 2026 SCC OnLine SC 187, the Hon’ble
        Supreme Court once again emphasised the responsibility that rests
        upon a Trial Court at the stage of framing of charge. It was observed
        that no individual should be compelled to face a criminal trial unless
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                          Page no. 528 of 549
        the material on record, even if taken at face value, discloses the
        essential ingredients of the alleged offence. To require an accused to
        undergo trial in the absence of such foundational material is to expose
        him to the strain, stigma and prolonged uncertainty that accompany
        criminal proceedings, without legal justification.

   1087.                    The Supreme Court also reminded courts that fidelity to
        the rule of law demands vigilance at this stage. If criminal proceedings
        are permitted to continue without adequate basis, the process itself
        may become punitive. A Trial Court, while exercising jurisdiction at
        the threshold, must therefore remain mindful of the human
        consequences of its orders and of the trust that society places in it. The
        relevant extract is reproduced below for ready reference:–

                “..21. Before parting with the matter, it is observed that at the
                stage of framing of charge or consideration of discharge, the
                Court is not engaged in an abstract legal exercise. It is
                concerned with real individuals, real anxieties, and the tangible
                burden of criminal prosecution. The responsibility cast upon
                the Court at this juncture demands circumspection, balance,
                and a candid evaluation of the material on record. The power
                to frame a charge is not to be exercised mechanically or merely
                by way of abundant caution. Where the material placed before
                the Court, even if taken at its face value, fails to disclose the
                essential ingredients of an offence, the law expects the Court to
                state so with clarity and to decline to subject the accused to
                trial.”
   1088.                    Keeping these principles in view, and bearing in mind
        the duty cast upon the Trial Court at this stage, it becomes necessary


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                            Page no. 529 of 549
        to address certain core issues so that the jurisdiction is exercised with
        due care and in faithful discharge of that responsibility.

        (i) Fair Investigation and Procedural Integrity in Light of Article 21 of
        the Constitution of India and International Covenant on Civil and
        Political Rights Obligations

   1089.                    At the very threshold of the defence arguments, learned
        counsel appearing for each of the accused persons had assiduously
        drawn the attention of this Court to the manner in which the statement
        of the approver, Dinesh Arora, came to be recorded repeatedly under
        Section 161 of Cr.P.C., on at least four occasions, after his statement
        under Section 164 of Cr.P.C., on the basis of which pardon had been
        granted to him. At that stage, the said submission did not appear to
        weigh substantially with this Court.

   1090.                    However, upon a holistic scrutiny of the entire record,
        and after this Court reached the conclusion that the prosecution case,
        as presented in the charge-sheet, rests largely on surmises, conjectures,
        and inferential leaps unsupported by cogent material, the aforesaid
        submission assumes decisive significance. What initially appeared to
        be a routine or peripheral objection now stands revealed as an issue
        going to the very root of fair investigation and the administration of
        criminal justice.




CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 530 of 549
   1091.                    This Court is constrained to observe that the present case
        does not admit of such a lapse being brushed aside as a mere
        irregularity. If such a practice is permitted to pass without judicial
        scrutiny, it carries the grave potential of setting an unhealthy
        precedent, effectively normalising a method whereby an investigating
        agency, after securing pardon on the professed premise of a “full and
        true disclosure”, continues to repeatedly re-record statements of the
        approver over an extended period, ostensibly to fill gaps, improve the
        prosecution narrative, implicate additional accused, or artificially
        weave missing links in the chain of circumstances.

   1092.                    The concern is aggravated by the fact that the
        investigating agency has offered no explanation whatsoever as to why
        it found it necessary to record the statement of the approver under
        Section 161 of Cr.P.C. repeatedly, and that too over a span of nearly
        one and a half years, extending till the filing of the last supplementary
        charge-sheet. The record is conspicuously silent on any exceptional
        circumstance warranting such a course. This unexplained conduct
        reflects a disturbing departure from the settled legal principles
        governing the grant of pardon.

   1093.                    The very foundation of pardon rests on the prosecution’s
        representation to the Court that the approver has made a full,
        voluntary, and truthful disclosure of all material facts within his
        knowledge. Once such disclosure is accepted and pardon is granted,

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 531 of 549
        the investigative discretion of the agency stands correspondingly
        circumscribed. The law does not contemplate a situation where an
        approver, having obtained the extraordinary indulgence of pardon, is
        thereafter subjected to repeated statement-recording under Section 161
        of Cr.P.C. so as to incrementally refine, expand, or reshape the
        prosecution case.

   1094.                    Such an approach strikes at the core of the concept of
        pardon and undermines the sanctity of the judicial satisfaction
        recorded at the stage of its grant. It gives rise to a legitimate
        apprehension that the approver’s subsequent statements are not the
        product of spontaneous disclosure, but of a prolonged and iterative
        process calibrated to suit the evolving requirements of the
        prosecution.
                                                               (emphasis supplied)

   1095.                    This Court is not embarking upon an examination of
        each and every statement of the approver, PW-20, recorded under
        Section 161 of Cr.P.C., whether prior to or subsequent to the recording
        of his confessional statement under Section 164 of Cr.P.C.. However,
        while adverting to the last statement under Section 161 of Cr.P.C.,
        recorded on 17.10.23 which forms part of the additional statements
        expressly relied upon by the investigating agency, this Court is taken
        by surprise to find an allegation relating to the delivery of an amount



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 532 of 549
        of ₹1 crore stated to have been handed over to one Sarvesh Mishra
        acting on behalf of Sanjay Singh.

   1096.                    What causes serious disquiet is that the name of Sanjay
        Singh does not find mention in the main charge-sheet or in any of the
        four supplementary charge-sheets. There is no allegation anywhere on
        the record attributing to Sanjay Singh any role, direct or indirect, in
        the formulation, approval, or implementation of the DEP-21/22. While
        this Court does not, at this stage, propose to enter into the merits of the
        said allegation, its very emergence at such a belated stage is indicative
        of the manner in which the approver’s statements have been utilised
        during investigation.

   1097.                    The record reveals that the approver, who has been
        examined on multiple occasions over an extended period of more then
        1 year, has come forth with this new allegation only in the course of
        his later statements. This lends credence to the apprehension that with
        each successive examination, fresh assertions are introduced to rope
        in persons against whom no foundational material otherwise exists.
        The approver appears to have been projected as an all-encompassing
        source for the prosecution narrative, such that on one occasion he
        introduces an entirely new allegation, and on another, seeks to supply
        explanations to fill links that are otherwise conspicuously absent in the
        evidentiary chain.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 533 of 549
   1098.                    It is a settled principle of criminal jurisprudence that the
        statement of an approver is inherently suspect and is to be received
        with great caution. Yet, the approach adopted by the investigating
        agency in the present case reflects a marked departure from this well-
        established rule. The statements of the approver have been elevated
        and treated as though they constitute unimpeachable truth, and have
        been uncritically incorporated as relied-upon material forming the
        backbone of the prosecution case.

   1099.                    Needless to observe, once a confession purporting to be
        a full and true disclosure is recorded and accepted for the grant of
        pardon, the premise on which such pardon rests cannot be permitted
        to stand diluted. The repeated examination of the approver over a
        period of one year, ostensibly to elicit further statements, itself
        demonstrates that what was projected as a complete disclosure
        gradually devolved into a series of incomplete and evolving versions.
        This aspect has been noted only to underscore the manner in which the
        investigation has proceeded in the present case, and the weight that
        has been placed on the shifting statements of the approver.

   1100.                    This Court remains conscious of the need to exercise
        restraint while commenting upon the conduct of the investigating
        agency. Ordinarily, courts refrain from making observations that may
        be perceived as indictments of investigative discretion. However, there
        are situations where the lapses are so fundamental that judicial silence

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                            Page no. 534 of 549
        would itself amount to abdication of duty. Where the exercise of
        power, though ostensibly within jurisdiction, results in the dilution of
        statutory safeguards and erosion of foundational principles of criminal
        jurisprudence, the Court cannot remain a mute spectator.

   1101.                    In the considered view of this Court, the manner in
        which the investigating agency has proceeded, by repeatedly recording
        the statements of the approver without justification and over a
        prolonged duration, reflects an exercise of discretion that cannot be
        characterised as fair or reasonable. If left unchecked, such conduct
        risks converting the exceptional mechanism of pardon into an
        instrument for narrative construction rather than truth discovery,
        thereby causing serious prejudice to the accused and eroding
        confidence in the criminal justice process.

                                                                (emphasis supplied)

   1102.                    Ignoring or glossing over such infirmities would, in the
        considered opinion of this Court, itself result in a miscarriage of
        justice. The guarantee of life and personal liberty under Article 21 of
        the Constitution of India is not confined to protection against unlawful
        detention alone, but necessarily encompasses the right to a fair and just
        investigation. Fairness in investigation is a constitutional mandate that
        restrains the exercise of State power and operates as a safeguard
        against arbitrary or capricious prosecutorial conduct.


CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 535 of 549
   1103.                    This constitutional guarantee is further reinforced by
        India’s international obligations under the Universal Declaration of
        Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political
        Rights, to which India is a signatory. Article 14 of the Covenant
        obligates the State to ensure equality before courts and tribunals, a fair
        and public hearing, and procedural fairness in criminal proceedings,
        while Article 15 prohibits the imposition of criminal liability except in
        accordance with law and recognised principles of criminal justice.
        These provisions collectively underscore that criminal prosecution
        must remain anchored in legality and procedural integrity, and must
        not be shaped or retrofitted through investigative practices that
        compromise fairness.

   1104.                    An investigation that departs from transparency,
        consistency, and procedural discipline, particularly by repeatedly re-
        recording statements of an approver after the grant of pardon without
        any disclosed justification, does not merely affect evidentiary
        appreciation, but strikes at the heart of these constitutional and
        international guarantees. Where investigative discretion is exercised
        in a manner that erodes the presumption of innocence or dilutes the
        sanctity of a judicially granted pardon, the process itself assumes a
        punitive character, impermissible in a constitutional democracy
        governed by the rule of law.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 536 of 549
   1105.                    In such circumstances, judicial intervention is not a
        matter of choice but of constitutional obligation. This Court is duty-
        bound to ensure that criminal law remains an instrument of justice and
        not a means of inflicting injustice, and that the promise of liberty under
        Article 21, read in harmony with India’s international human-rights
        commitments under the ICCPR, is preserved in both letter and spirit.

        (ii) Segregation of Relied and Unrelied Documents: To Uncover the
        Truth and Safeguard a Fair Trial

   1106.                    At the stage of consideration of charge, particularly in
        prosecutions under the PC Act and in connected proceedings under the
        Prevention of Money Laundering Act, the question of classification
        and supply of documents assumes substantial significance. The
        prosecution is obliged to furnish copies of the documents upon which
        it relies and to provide inspection along with a list of documents not
        relied upon. While this arrangement satisfies procedural requirements,
        its practical impact at the stage of charge calls for closer
        examination.

   1107.                    At this stage, the Court is confined to the material placed
        by the prosecution. The accused has no right to rely upon his own
        documents, nor can he summon documents that form part of the
        unrelied record. Consequently, even where inspection of unrelied
        documents is permitted, the defence is not in a position to effectively
        invoke such material while the Court determines whether a case is
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                           Page no. 537 of 549
        made out for trial. In effect, the Court’s scrutiny remains restricted to
        what the prosecution chooses to place in the category of relied
        documents. This concern becomes particularly acute in cases of a
        voluminous nature, where trials may extend over several years.

   1108.                    The issue becomes clearer by way of illustration. Suppose
        a person is accused of committing a murder in Delhi by firing a
        gunshot. He is arrested in Lucknow. During investigation, the police
        seize from his residence a digital device containing CCTV footage
        showing his presence at home at the relevant time. The footage
        supports a plea of alibi. If the investigating agency, instead of sending
        the device for forensic examination and placing the material before the
        Court as part of the relied documents, merely includes it in the list of
        unrelied documents without analysis, the consequences are serious. At
        the stage of charge, the accused cannot summon that material. The
        Court would be compelled to assess the prosecution case without
        considering evidence already in the custody of the State that may
        directly bear upon innocence. The accused would then have to await
        the stage of defence evidence to seek its production, by which time
        charges would already have been framed on an incomplete record.

   1109.                Such a course affects the very foundation of a fair procedure.
        Investigation is not a process of gathering only incriminating material;
        it is an effort to uncover the truth. Every document collected during
        investigation must be examined objectively before any decision is

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 538 of 549
        taken to classify it as relied or unrelied. Segregation must follow due
        scrutiny; it cannot precede it. Fair trial requires that the investigating
        agency assess the evidentiary value and relevance of each document
        in a balanced manner.

   1110.                 Where a document of apparent probative value, particularly
        one capable of assisting the accused, is placed in the unrelied category,
        reasons for such a decision ought to be recorded. The recording of
        reasons ensures that exclusion of material is based on a conscious and
        reasoned determination rather than expediency. It also enables the
        Court to satisfy itself that relevant material has not been withheld from
        consideration without justification. In the absence of such
        transparency, the classification of documents risks becoming a means
        of selective presentation.

   1111.                     This Court has, on more than one occasion, noticed
        instances where documents emerging from the investigation, including
        those recovered from the accused, have been placed among unrelied
        documents despite their potential relevance. When material favourable
        to the accused is collected by the State and thereafter kept outside the
        Court’s consideration at the stage of charge, the fairness of the process
        is inevitably brought into question.

   1112.                     The purpose of investigation is to ascertain the truth,
        whether it supports the prosecution or assists the defence. The
        guarantee of a fair trial under Article 21 extends to every stage of the
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 539 of 549
        criminal process, including investigation and the manner in which
        material is presented before the Court. The distinction between relied
        and unrelied documents cannot be permitted to operate in a way that
        dilutes this guarantee.

   1113.                     Before segregating documents into relied and unrelied
        categories, the investigating agency must undertake a comprehensive
        and objective examination of all material collected. If, upon such
        examination, a decision is taken not to rely upon a particular
        document, the reasons for doing so should be clearly recorded. Such
        an approach alone ensures fairness, accountability, and fidelity to the
        fundamental objective of criminal law, the discovery of truth through
        a just and even-handed process.

        (iii) Use of the Phrase “South Group”

   1114.                    The Court considers it necessary to place on record its
        concern with the repeated and deliberate use of the expression “South
        Group” by the investigating agency to describe a set of accused
        persons, ostensibly on the basis of their regional origin or place of
        residence. Such a nomenclature finds no foundation in law, does not
        correspond to any legally cognisable classification, and is wholly alien
        to the statutory framework governing criminal liability. It is equally
        significant that no comparable regional descriptor has been employed
        for the remaining accused persons; the prosecution narrative does not
        speak of any “North Group” or similar categorisation. The selective
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 540 of 549
        adoption of a geographically defined label is, therefore, plainly
        arbitrary and unwarranted.

   1115.                    The concern is not confined to semantics. Region-based
        labelling carries an avoidable undertone and is capable of creating a
        prejudicial impression. It detracts from the settled requirement that
        criminal proceedings must remain dispassionate, evidence-centric,
        and insulated from extraneous considerations. In a constitutional order
        founded upon equality before law and the unity and integrity of the
        nation, descriptors rooted in regional identity serve no legitimate
        investigative            or   prosecutorial   purpose   and   are      manifestly
        inappropriate.

   1116.                    This Court is conscious that the impugned expression
        has been repeatedly employed in successive charge-sheets and, for that
        limited reason alone, this Court has been constrained to refer to it
        while summarising and analysing the prosecution case. Such reference
        cannot, however, be construed as approval or endorsement of the
        terminology itself. The continued use of this label, despite the absence
        of any legally sustainable basis, carries a real risk of colouring
        perception, causing unintended prejudice, and diverting focus from the
        evidentiary material, which alone must guide adjudication.

   1117.                    The impropriety of identity-based labelling is not a
        matter of abstract concern. It has received pointed judicial
        condemnation in comparative constitutional jurisprudence. In United
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                              Page no. 541 of 549
        States v. Cabrera, 222 F.3d 590 (7th Cir. 2000), the United States Court
        of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit treated the issue as going to the very
        root of a fair criminal trial, and went so far as to set aside the
        conviction itself on account of the repeated use of identity-based
        terminology by the prosecution and law-enforcement witnesses, where
        such identity had no bearing on the elements of the offence.

   1118.                    The Court recorded its disapproval in unambiguous
        terms:

        “The government’s repeated references to the defendants as
        ‘Dominican drug dealers’ were improper.
        The ethnicity or national origin of a defendant is not relevant to
        proving the elements of a crime.
        Such references invite the jury to draw impermissible inferences based
        on nationality rather than evidence, and they risk appealing to bias
        rather than reason.”
   1119.                    Emphasising that this was not an isolated concern, the
        Court expressly cautioned the prosecution:

        “We have warned prosecutors before that injecting ethnicity into a
        criminal trial, when it has no bearing on the issues being tried, is
        error.
        Criminal trials must be about what the defendant did, not who the
        defendant is.”
   1120.                    The admonition was extended beyond prosecutorial
        argument to the conduct of law-enforcement officials themselves,




CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 542 of 549
        recognising that prejudice can be introduced through investigative
        narrative and statement:

        “The fairness and integrity of criminal trials are at stake if we allow
        police officers to make generalizations about racial and ethnic groups
        in order to obtain convictions.
        People cannot be tried on the basis of their ethnic backgrounds or
        national origin.”
   1121.                    On this reasoning, the Court held that the continued and
        unnecessary emphasis on ethnic origin had irretrievably compromised
        the constitutional guarantee of a fair trial and concluded:

        “Therefore, in order to protect Cabrera and Mulgado’s due process and
        equal protection rights to a fair trial, we are compelled to reverse their
        convictions and remand.”
   1122.                    The principle that emerges is both clear and compelling.
        Identity-based labelling, whether by ethnicity, nationality, or regional
        origin, cannot be employed as a prosecutorial shorthand where such
        identity is irrelevant to the offence. Such labelling is not a mere
        irregularity of expression; it constitutes a constitutional infirmity
        capable of undermining the fairness of the proceedings themselves.
        The central message is categorical: criminal adjudication must rest on
        conduct proved by evidence, not on who the accused is or where he
        comes from.
                                                                (emphasis supplied)




CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 543 of 549
   1123.                    In light of the above, the investigating agency is
        cautioned to exercise greater care, circumspection, and restraint in the
        choice of language while drafting charge-sheets and investigative
        narratives. Descriptions of accused persons must remain strictly
        neutral, evidence-based, and free from expressions that carry a
        stigmatic, divisive, or pejorative overtone. The continued use of such
        terminology bears directly upon the fairness of the criminal process
        and touches upon the guarantee of a just, fair, and reasonable
        procedure under Article 21 of the Constitution. Equally, the
        employment of descriptors founded on regional or identity-based
        distinctions, in the absence of any rational nexus with the alleged
        offence, is inconsistent with the constitutional command of equality
        and non-discrimination under Article 15. Persistence with such
        nomenclature risks undermining the due process of law and is best
        avoided in the interest of an impartial and constitutionally compliant
        administration of criminal justice.

        (iv) Constitutional Significance:

   1124.                    Before parting with the order, it becomes necessary for
        this Court to record a concern of considerable constitutional
        significance. This Court is increasingly confronted with a grave and
        recurring dilemma, wherein the liberty of an individual stands
        imperilled on account of prosecutions initiated under the Prevention
        of Money Laundering Act, 2002, premised upon a presumption that

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                        Page no. 544 of 549
        the alleged amount constitutes “proceeds of crime” arising out of a
        scheduled (predicate) offence. The issue assumes heightened
        significance where an accused is arrested for the offence of money
        laundering and is thereafter required to surmount the stringent twin
        conditions prescribed for the grant of bail, resulting in prolonged
        incarceration even at the pre-trial stage.

   1125.                    It is noticed that, in several cases, the Enforcement
        Directorate proceeds to file a prosecution complaint primarily to
        obviate the statutory consequence of default bail, without the
        investigation in the scheduled offence having attained finality. In such
        situations, while the proceedings under the PMLA are set in motion,
        the investigation in the predicate offence continues to remain
        inconclusive, and in many cases even the filing of a charge-sheet
        therein is awaited. This Court itself is a witness to a case where the
        proceedings relating to money laundering have reached the final stage
        of arguments on charge, whereas, in the predicate offence, the
        investigation is still underway to determine whether any offence has
        been committed at all. It is also noteworthy that the accused persons
        in the PMLA case have remained in custody for a significant period.
        This anomalous situation gives rise to serious legal and constitutional
        concerns, as the continuation of proceedings under the PMLA remains
        contingent upon the very survival of the scheduled offence.



CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 545 of 549
   1126.                    It has been categorically held by the Hon’ble Supreme
        Court of India in Vijay Madanlal Choudhary v. Union of India, (2022)
        10 SCC 353, that where the predicate offence does not survive,
        whether on account of discharge, acquittal, quashing, denial of
        cognizance, or acceptance of a closure report, the offence of money
        laundering cannot independently subsist. The offence under the PMLA
        is thus not autonomous in its origin, but is inextricably linked to the
        existence of a legally sustainable scheduled offence. The predicate
        offence constitutes the foundational edifice upon which the allegation
        of money laundering rests; if the foundation crumbles, the
        superstructure must necessarily fall.

                                                                   (emphasis supplied)

   1127.                    Despite this settled legal position, the prevailing practice
        reveals a disturbing inversion of the statutory scheme, wherein
        coercive powers of arrest and prolonged custody are invoked even
        before the foundational facts relating to the scheduled offence are
        judicially tested. This results in a situation where an individual is
        deprived of personal liberty on the strength of an allegation whose
        legal sustainability remains uncertain and contingent upon a future
        outcome in a parallel investigation.

   1128.                    The right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under
        Article 21 of the Constitution mandates that any deprivation of liberty
        must be just, fair, and reasonable, not merely in form, but in substance.
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                            Page no. 546 of 549
        A procedure which permits prolonged or indefinite incarceration on
        the basis of a provisional and untested allegation, while the very
        substratum of the offence remains under investigation, risks
        degenerating into a punitive process rather than a regulatory or
        investigative one. Liberty, once curtailed, cannot be meaningfully
        restored by a subsequent acquittal, nor can the passage of time
        compensate for the loss occasioned by unwarranted pre-trial
        detention.

   1129.                    At the same time, it cannot be gainsaid that the
        legislature has vested wide powers in the Enforcement Directorate to
        combat the menace of money laundering, including powers of
        attachment, arrest, and prosecution, recognising the transnational and
        clandestine nature of such offences. The object of the statute is
        undoubtedly legitimate and compelling. However, statutory power,
        howsoever wide, cannot eclipse constitutional safeguards. The
        exercise of such power must therefore be harmonised with the settled
        principle that arrest and prolonged incarceration are exceptions, and
        not the rule.

   1130.                    There is, thus, a manifest need to evolve a framework
        for striking a careful balance between the sovereign interest in the
        effective investigation of economic offences and the inviolable right
        of an individual to personal liberty. While provisional attachment of
        alleged proceeds of crime may be justified to preserve the subject-

CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                       Page no. 547 of 549
        matter of investigation, the coercive measure of arrest and the
        consequent application of onerous bail conditions cannot be permitted
        to operate mechanically in the absence of a crystallised and judicially
        cognisable predicate offence.

   1131.                    In this context, it is apposite to note that the Hon’ble
        Supreme Court in Manish Sisodia v. State (NCT of Delhi) , (2023) 9
        SCC 772, has observed that prolonged and indefinite incarceration
        without the commencement or conclusion of trial constitutes a relevant
        consideration for the grant of bail. This Court, therefore, remains alive
        to the fact that the continuation of incarceration in such circumstances
        amounts to placing the cart before the horse, allowing the consequence
        to precede the cause, so that pre-trial detention does not itself
        substitute the punishment.

   1132.                    Ultimately, the legitimacy of the PMLA regime depends
        not merely on the severity of its provisions, but on their fair,
        proportionate, and constitutionally informed application. The balance
        between the power of the investigating agency and the right to life and
        personal liberty is not a matter of legislative grace, but a constitutional
        command. Any failure to maintain this balance is likely to undermine
        both the rule of law and public confidence in the administration of
        criminal justice.

   1133.                    As the order reaches its conclusion, this Court, while
        penning the present order, has, time and again, reminded itself of the
CBI Vs. Kuldeep Singh & others                                         Page no. 548 of 549
        enduring words of Martin Luther King Jr. that “injustice anywhere is
        a threat to justice everywhere,” as also of the venerable maxim fiat
        justitia ruat caelum, let justice be done though the heavens may fall.
        These principles serve as a constant reminder that the judicial task is
        neither to secure a convenient outcome nor to endorse a dominant
        narrative, but to uphold the rule of law. It is only by remaining
        anchored to these ideals that the confidence of the citizen in the
        administration of justice is preserved. With that assurance, and
        conscious of this obligation, the file is directed to be consigned to the
        record room.

                         SUBMISSIONS ON THE POINT OF CHARGE


(I)        Submissions by Ld. ASG/SPP Sh. D. P. Singh, Ld. Senior PP Sh. Satish Kumar
           Garg, Ld. Counsels Sh. Manu Mishra, Ms. Garima Saxena, Ms. Shreya
           Dutt, Sh. Imaan Khera and Sh. Dig Vijay Singh, for Central Bureau of
           Investigation :-
      1.          It is submitted that the Delhi Excise Policy 2021–22 (hereinafter “the
           Policy”) was not a bona fide fiscal reform but a calibrated instrument designed to
           generate large-scale illegal gratification through deliberate margin manipulation
           and structural alterations in the licensing regime. The proceeds so generated were
           intended to be distributed and utilised for political purposes. The prosecution case,
           when viewed cumulatively, discloses a concerted and pre-conceived design, the
           full conspectus of which emerges from the totality of circumstances. The material
           collected during investigation reveals a single, continuing criminal conspiracy
           commencing from the very inception of the Policy and culminating in the
           generation, layering and utilisation of kickbacks in the Goa Assembly elections.
           The conspiracy is stated to have been conceived at the highest political level,
           where the policy framework was altered to introduce a private wholesale regime
           with an enhanced margin of 12% in place of the existing 5%, and turnover criteria
           were relaxed despite expert recommendations to the contrary.
      2.           It is also submitted that the conspiracy took root at the stage of policy
           formulation itself. Contrary to the recommendations of the Ravi Dhawan
           Committee, which sought safeguards against manufacturer–retailer nexus and
           concentration of control, material deviations were introduced to favour the South
           Group. The mode and manner of finalisation of the Policy, including alleged
           instructions issued to Rahul Singh by Manish Sisodia (A-8), removal of legal
           opinions, insertion of procured and fabricated public comments to suit a
           predetermined narrative, initiation of a fresh note, the absence of the earlier
           Cabinet note, non-consideration of excise department inputs during GoM
           deliberations, alignment of the GoM Report with documents originating from the
           South Group, and dilution of eligibility criteria; collectively demonstrate that the
           changes were not administrative adjustments but foundational acts in furtherance
           of a pre-arranged quid pro quo. Digital material recovered from the devices of the


                                             Page no. 1 of 48
     accused is stated to evidence the influence of the South Group and other
     stakeholders in the formulation and implementation of the Policy.
3.         It is further submitted that the conspiracy involved political executives,
     public servants, private entities and intermediaries, each performing a defined
     role:
            (a) Arvind Kejriwal (A-18) and Manish Sisodia (A-8) are projected as
     principal political actors. Manish Sisodia, being Minister for Excise and Finance,
     is alleged to have been instrumental in the formulation and implementation of the
     Policy. Arvind Kejriwal, as overall in-charge of AAP, is stated to have overseen
     major decisions. Durgesh Pathak (A-19) and Vijay Nair (A-3), closely associated
     with them, are alleged to have worked in proximity to achieve the objectives of
     the conspiracy. Arjun Pandey (A-10) is stated to be closely associated with Vijay
     Nair.
            (b) Kuldeep Singh (A-1) and Narender Singh (A-2), both excise officials,
     are alleged to have ensured grant of L-1 licence in favour of entities linked to the
     South Group.
            (c) The South Group, headed by K. Kavitha (A-17), is stated to comprise
     Sarath Reddy (A-23), Abhishek Boinpally (A-4), Arun Pillai (A-5), Mootha
     Gautam (A-6) and Butchibabu (A-11). It is alleged that this group was favoured
     by grant of L-1 licence to Indospirits, in which Sameer Mahendru (A-7) is a
     stakeholder. Arvind Kumar Singh (A-15) is alleged to be closely linked to the
     South Group. Amandeep Singh Dhall (A-9) is projected as another beneficiary
     who agreed to facilitate recoupment of upfront payments to be utilised in the Goa
     elections for favours extended under the Policy.
            (d) Other accused, including Vinod Chauhan (A-21) {allegedly closely
     linked to Arvind Kejriwal (A-18)}, Ashish Mathur (A-22), Rajesh Joshi (A-12),
     Damodar Prasad Sharma (A-13) and Arvind Kumar Singh (A-15), are alleged to
     have facilitated transfer of kickbacks through hawala channels to Goa. Chanpreet
     Singh (A-16) and Prince Kumar (A-14) are stated to have received such funds for
     election expenditure. The routing is alleged to have been undertaken at the behest
     of Durgesh Pathak (A-19), election in-charge of Goa, and Vijay Nair (A-3). Amit
     Arora (A-20) is alleged to have played a critical role in recoupment of upfront



                                       Page no. 2 of 48
     bribe amounts, particularly by targeting wholesalers who refused to give
     kickbacks.
4.         It is contended that the prosecution summarises the conspiracy under the
     following heads:
     (i) deliberate inflation of margins and relaxation of eligibility norms;
     (ii) negotiation and structuring of upfront bribe and its recovery mechanism;
     (iii) induction of proxy beneficiary entities;
     (iv) manipulation of the licensing process;
     (v) transfer and utilisation of kickbacks in Goa elections; and
     (vi) destruction or concealment of evidence to evade culpability.

5.          It is also contended that It is submitted that at the stage of charge, the Court
     is not required to conduct a meticulous appreciation of individual pieces of
     evidence. The cumulative effect of the material on record, read as a whole,
     discloses a continuing conspiracy extending from policy formulation to utilisation
     of alleged proceeds and further conduct of the accused after registration of the
     case. Vijay Nair (A-3)is projected as a key intermediary who, being Media In-
     Charge and a close confidant of the then Chief Minister, identified and engaged
     with the South Group and coordinated with executors including Sameer
     Mahendru (A-7), Amandeep Singh Dhall (A-9), Dinesh Arora and Arjun Pandey
     (A-10) to implement the alleged design. His involvement in policy formulation
     and coordination with the South Group is asserted to be established by material on
     record.
6.         It is also contended that the bureaucratic machinery was utilised to tweak
     the policy document; the Ravi Dhawan Report was disregarded; public comments
     were manipulated; and legal opinions were excluded. The earlier file containing
     these deliberations is stated to be missing. It is further alleged that the Policy was
     cleared with undue haste during the peak COVID wave and that LG comments
     were manipulated despite an internal note asserting the subject to be a “transferred
     subject” requiring no input from the LG. It is further alleged that members of the
     South Group travelled by private aircraft during the relevant period and furnished
     a 36-page draft document, allegedly taken from Oberoi Hotel, to Vijay Nair, who


                                        Page no. 3 of 48
     is stated to be in close proximity with Manish Sisodia (A-8) and Arvind Kejriwal
     (A-18). The prosecution asserts that the South Group apportioned responsibility
     among themselves to pay an upfront amount of approximately ₹100 crores, to be
     subsequently recouped. Payments of ₹25 crores are stated to have been made by
     Raghav Magunta to Butchibabu (A-11) and Abhishek Boinpally (A-4) in March
     and June 2021. It is further alleged that ₹14 crores were paid by Sarath Reddy
     (A-23) to K. Kavitha (A-17) under the guise of a land transaction and ₹80 lakhs
     were paid by his company to an NGO associated with her. It is alleged that upon
     formulation of the Policy, disputes arose regarding distribution arrangements.
     Amandeep Singh Dhall (A-9) is stated to have preferred distribution for both M/s
     Pernod Ricard India Pvt. Ltd. and M/s DIAGEO; however, the South Group
     allegedly insisted on a single vendor arrangement to retain control. Vijay Nair
     (A-3) is stated to have played a crucial role in this arrangement, resulting in Dhall
     being distributor for M/s DIAGEO. Sameer Mahendru (A-7) is alleged to have
     been used as a front for Indospirits, with manipulation extending from
     shareholding patterns to securing L-1 licence through Kuldeep Singh (A-1) and
     Narender Singh (A-2). An alleged payment of ₹30 lakhs to Narender Singh is
     cited as facilitation. The upfront amount is also alleged to have been routed
     through the South Group into the account of Indospirits due to shortage of funds
     with Sameer Mahendru (A-7).
7.          It is further contended that the prosecution further submits that the largest
     market share of M/s Pernod Ricard India Pvt. Ltd. and M/s DIAGEO was
     allocated between Indospirits and Brindco, while the remaining 20% market share
     was placed under an umbrella distributorship of M/s Mahadev Liquors. There is
     stated to be sufficient material indicating efforts to usurp this remaining market
     share, with Vijay Nair, Amit Arora (A-20), Dinesh Arora and elements within the
     Punjab bureaucracy playing significant roles. The meetings at Gauri Apartments
     on 21.05.2021 and ITC Kohinoor on 19.06.2021 are projected as pivotal events
     where capture of retail zones and the disbursal mechanism of bribe money were
     finalised. Booking of the venue on 21.05.2021 is stated to have been facilitated by
     Durgesh Pathak (A-19) through Bibhav Kumar, PA to Arvind Kejriwal (A-18).
     While the South Group secured shareholding in Indospirits, Brindco was allegedly
     tasked with facilitating recoupment through excess credit notes. The prosecution
     alleges that Arun Pillai invested ₹3.40 crores for 32.50% shareholding in


                                       Page no. 4 of 48
     Indospirits on behalf of the South Group, the investment having been procured by
     K. Kavitha (A-17). Approximately 61% of profits amounting to ₹29.29 crores
     (post-tax) are alleged to have been transferred to Arun Pillai (A-5) or on his
     instructions. Funds were further routed to Abhishek Boinpally (A-4) and Mootha
     Gautam (A-6) and/or their linked entities through layered transfers, sham
     agreements and media-related payments. Arjun Pandey is stated to have received
     ₹85 lakhs from India Ahead News.
8.          The prosecution submitted that excess credit notes of ₹4.97 crores were
     issued by Amandeep Singh Dhall (A-9) of Brindco to generate surplus margins
     equivalent to an agreed 6% kickback, thereby facilitating recovery of the upfront
     bribe from inflated margins. Through this mechanism, the South Group is stated
     to have recouped ₹2.58 crores through four entities. The prosecution asserts that
     ₹44.54 crores collected from the South Group was transferred to Goa through
     angadia channels with the assistance of Arvind Kumar Singh (A-15), Rajesh Joshi
     (A-12), Damodar Prasad Sharma (A-13), Vinod Chauhan (A-21) and Ashish
     Mathur (A-22). The funds were allegedly received by Chanpreet Singh and Prince
     Kumar on instructions of Durgesh Pathak (A-19) and Vijay Nair (A-3) and
     utilised for election-related expenditure in Goa, including campaign material,
     hotel and hospitality expenses, and monetary support to individual candidates to
     the extent of ₹90 lakhs each.
9. The prosecution also relies upon subsequent conduct as indicative of
   consciousness of guilt, including:
     (a) change of mobile phone by Manish Sisodia (A-8) on 22.07.2022, the date on
     which the MHA referred the matter to CBI;
     (b) alleged attempts by Amandeep Singh Dhall (A-9) to pass excess credit notes
     after registration of the case;
     (c) retention by Sarath Reddy (A-23) of ₹46.88 crores payable to Indospirits upon
     withdrawal of the Policy on 31.08.2022; and
     (d) seizure of confidential policy documents from the premises of Amandeep
     Singh Dhall (A-9) during investigation. On the basis of the above, it is submitted
     that the material on record, when taken cumulatively, discloses grave suspicion of
     a structured and continuing criminal conspiracy warranting framing of charges.

      (II)   Submissions by Ld. Counsels Sh. S.S. Rana, Sh. Naveen Kumar and Sh.
             Abhishek Mahal, for A-1 Kuldeep Singh :-

10.          It is submitted that a bare perusal of the prosecution material does not
      disclose any evidence of demand, acceptance or obtaining of any undue advantage
      by A-1. In the absence of proof of demand or acceptance, the foundational
      ingredients of Section 7 of the PC Act are wholly absent. There is no allegation,
      direct or indirect, of any act, conduct, agreement or understanding attributable to
      A-1 suggestive of criminal intent or participation. The statement of PW-20 Dinesh
      Arora dated 27.10.2022, forming the basis of the charge-sheet, is exculpatory qua
      A-1. The alleged payment of ₹30 lakh is confined exclusively to A-2 and the
      statement contains no reference or attribution to A-1, who was DC (Excise). As
      per PW-20, the projected chain is: Sameer Mahendru → Dinesh Arora → Vijay
      Nair → Arava Gopi Krishna → Vijay Nair → Dinesh Arora → Narender Singh.
      A-1 does not appear at any stage. The assertion that only Indospirit’s licence was
      approved on 05.11.2021 is factually incorrect, as M/s Diwan Spirit and M/s Rohan
      Transport were also approved on that date, while Indospirit’s licence was granted
      on 08.11.2021, negating any preferential treatment.
11.          It is further submitted that the prosecution’s own material shows that any
      alleged pressure originated from the Deputy CM. PW-74 Arava Gopi Krishna
      stated that he was directed by the Deputy CM to expedite Indospirit’s licence and
      conveyed the same to Narender Singh. Even as per PW-74’s statements under
      Sections 161 and 164 CrPC, the alleged chain is: Dy. CM → Arava Gopi Krishna
      → Narender Singh. A-1 is not named or implicated.
12.          It is contended that conspiracy postulates agreement or meeting of minds.
      The prosecution has placed no witness statement, document, call record or
      financial trail connecting A-1 with any conspiratorial act. PW-20 names Narender
      Singh but not A-1. PW-74, even under Section 164 CrPC, names Narender Singh
      but not A-1. This omission is substantive. A-1 was not named in the FIR dated
      17.08.2022. No fresh investigation was conducted qua A-1 after grant of sanction
      under Section 17A PC Act, and any pre-sanction investigation against him is
      legally unsustainable. Parity has been violated. Anand Tiwari and Pankaj
      Bhatnagar, who dealt with the same complaint, have been cleared. Arava Gopi
      Krishna has been discharged. The CBI’s own record acknowledges, at the highest,

                                       Page no. 6 of 48
      negligence and not conspiracy. The alleged bribe relates only to Narender Singh,
      yet an artificial linkage has been created with A-1. All other officers were
      suspended in August 2022, whereas A-1 was suspended only upon filing of the
      charge-sheet on 24.11.2022, reflecting discriminatory treatment in violation of
      Article 14.
13.          It is also contended that on merits, the record shows strict adherence to
      guidelines. The IMPL application was issued the maximum deficiency memos.
      Indospirit’s licence took 60 days, the longest among applicants. IDL was common
      to both applications. The first IMPL application was withdrawn under Rule 35 of
      the Delhi Excise Rules, 2010. The second Indospirit application satisfied
      eligibility, as IDL acted as permissible agent of a manufacturer. PW-07 Ashok
      Kumar’s comparative data shows licences were normally granted in 7–42 days,
      whereas Indospirit took 60 days. There was no policy violation. The blacklisting
      of Sameer Mahendru stood stayed. The anonymous complaint, though non-est
      under CVC guidelines, was examined. No EMD irregularity was found, and
      Wholesale L-1 licences did not require EMD. Any funding or relatedness issue
      would have affected both retail and wholesale licences, which did not occur. A-1’s
      role as Chairman of the Transition Committee was confined to ensuring uniform
      and time-bound processing. He had no role in litigation and no knowledge of any
      writ petition. In the first IMPL application, mandatory turnover and experience
      certificates were not furnished and the third deficiency memo dated 27.10.2021
      was not replied to. In the second Indospirit application, certificates issued by
      Excise Officers of UP and Delhi for B9 Beverages were duly furnished and
      verified. Excluding IMPL turnover, IDL did not meet the ₹150-crore threshold in
      the first application.
14.         It is further contended that A-1 has an unblemished service record with
      outstanding APARs, detected major revenue fraud, implemented “One Nation One
      Ration”, and discharged sensitive assignments. He was not suspended when the
      matter was referred to the CBI and, after revocation of suspension on 16.09.2025,
      was posted as DIG (Prison), reflecting continued governmental confidence. The
      processing chart proved through PW-07 demonstrates uniformity and absence of
      preferential treatment. In the totality of circumstances, no prima facie case is
      disclosed against A-1. The essential ingredients of the alleged offences are absent.



                                        Page no. 7 of 48
      Continuation of proceedings would amount to abuse of process and A-1 deserves
      discharge.

      (III) Submissions by Ld. Counsels Sh. Pardeep Rana, Sh. Gagan Bhatnagar, Sh.
            Tushar Rohmetra and Sh. Vibhor Choudhary, for A-2 Narender Singh :-

15.           It is contended that the prosecution has failed to establish the indispensable
      ingredient of demand of illegal gratification, which is the sine qua non for
      offences under Sections 7 and 7A of the PC Act. Even if the prosecution case and
      the testimonies of its witnesses are taken at their highest, no allegation of demand
      is attributable to A-2. The statements of PW-20 Dinesh Arora, PW-18 Suman and
      PW-19 Sachin do not disclose any such demand. It is an admitted position that no
      recovery of the alleged sum of ₹30 lakhs has been effected despite searches
      conducted after sanction under Section 17A PC Act. In the absence of proof of
      demand, the prosecution case collapses at the threshold, as held in Neeraj Dutta v.
      State and P. Satyanarayana Murthy v. State of A.P.
16.          It is further contended that the prosecution case hinges primarily on PW-20
      Dinesh Arora, whose statements are hearsay, mutually inconsistent and materially
      contradictory. His statements under Sections 161 and 164 CrPC do not
      consistently implicate A-2. The sole allegation against A-2 appears for the first
      time in the statement dated 27.10.2022, recorded immediately prior to the filing of
      the application under Section 306 CrPC on 01.11.2022, clearly indicating an
      afterthought introduced to secure pardon. No incriminating statement has been
      made against A-2 after PW-20 was granted pardon on 16.11.2022. It is settled law
      that the uncorroborated testimony of an approver or co-accused cannot sustain a
      charge, as held in Yogender Mittal v. CBI and Haricharan Kurmi v. State of Bihar.
17.          Ld. Counsel submitted that the prosecution witnesses have categorically
      stated that pressure emanated from the then Deputy CM to process the Indospirit
      application expeditiously and that A-2 merely acted in compliance with directions
      conveyed by PW-74 Arva Gopi Krishna. This is corroborated by PW-71 C. Arvind
      and PW-74 Arva Gopi Krishna in their statements under Sections 161 and 164
      CrPC. The record shows that A-2 acted strictly in accordance with directions of
      his superiors, namely Kuldeep Singh, DC (Excise), and Arva Gopi Krishna. No
      independent discretion or deviation is attributed to him. Further, the prosecution

                                        Page no. 8 of 48
      has failed to establish the alleged mobile-phone location near Khan Market;
      PW-23 does not support this link, leaving the chain incomplete.
18.          It is also submitted that the allegation of undue haste or improper grant of
      licence is incorrect. The earlier application dated 09.09.2021 admittedly suffered
      from deficiencies. The subsequent application was independently scrutinised and
      processed after compliance with VAT, IEC and turnover requirements. The
      deficiency regarding ₹150 crore turnover was cured by disclosure of Indospirit as
      distributor of M/s B9 Beverages Pvt. Ltd., whereafter the L-1 licence was issued
      on 08.11.2021. Issuance of licences on the same day was routine, as reflected by
      the licence granted to M/s Goldsun Garments on 09.11.2021 without any
      deficiency memo. A-2 acted strictly in accordance with the Excise Policy and on
      the basis of undertakings under Annexure-B, and was under no obligation to
      investigate familial or indirect shareholding.
19.          Further, it is argued that clause 1.5 of the Excise Policy defines cartelisation
      as majority ownership of 51% or more. Officers were bound to examine
      applications only within this framework and under Section 34(1) of the Delhi
      Excise Rules, 2010. The allegation of cartelisation through cross-funding of EMD
      was independently examined by the Retail Branch through a show-cause notice
      dated 09.11.2021, and the Deputy Controller of Accounts clarified that EMD and
      participation fees paid by demand drafts are valid even if not from the applicant’s
      own account. Senior officers Anand Tiwari and Pankaj Bhatnagar were placed in
      Column 12 and not charge-sheeted. Likewise, Arva Gopi Krishna, PW-18 Suman
      and PW-19 Sachin were not charge-sheeted despite their admitted roles,
      demonstrating selective prosecution against A-2.
20.         It is submitted that neither the tender conditions nor the Excise Policy
      2021–22 required registration of a joint venture, a fact admitted by prosecution
      witnesses. The petition filed by Varun Chaudhary was forwarded to the
      department only on 08.11.2021 and was confined to the Retail Branch; it was
      never before the L-1 Wholesale Branch and the present accused had no role
      therein. Ld. Counsels concluded their arguments submitting that an offence under
      Section 120-B IPC cannot survive in the absence of material showing a meeting
      of minds or agreement to commit an illegal act. Even if the entire prosecution
      material is accepted at face value, no prima facie case or grave suspicion arises


                                         Page no. 9 of 48
      against A-2. Continuation of proceedings would amount to abuse of process of
      law and A-2 is entitled to discharge.


      (IV) Submissions by Ld. Senior Advocate Sh. Madhav Khurana, Ld. Counsels
           Ms. Stuti Gujral, Ms. Vrinda Bhandari, Sh. Piyush Kumar, Sh. Nishant
           Sharma, Sh. Syed Miran Ahmad, Ms. Vidushi Sabharwal, Sh. Arjun V.
           Harihar and Sh.Vipin Kumar, for A-3 Vijay Nair :-

21.          It is submitted that A-3 has been summoned in the present proceedings in
      his capacity as a private individual for the alleged offences u/s 7, 7A and 8 of the
      PC Act, read with Section 120-B of the IPC. For each of the alleged substantive
      offences, the prosecution was required, at the threshold, to identify a public
      servant at least by designation or capacity and to demonstrate the specific public
      duty which was allegedly influenced, or sought to be influenced, by him. This
      foundational requirement has not been satisfied. In the absence of a prima facie
      substantive offence, the allegation of criminal conspiracy u/s 120-B IPC cannot
      survive, as conspiracy presupposes an unlawful object capable of being
      established. A-3 is a private individual who founded a private entertainment
      company, “Only Much Louder”, and later associated himself with the Aam Aadmi
      Party in 2014 as a volunteer without remuneration. Owing to his professional
      background, he assisted the media and communications team of the party by
      publicising its activities and relaying stakeholder feedback. His professional
      engagements had brought him into contact with stakeholders in the alcohol
      industry in connection with events and festivals sponsored by such entities. The
      prosecution record does not disclose any close or proximate association between
      A-3 and any of the accused public servants. There is no material to indicate that
      he acted as an agent, intermediary or representative of any public servant. Not a
      single meeting between him and any public servant during the alleged period of
      conspiracy has been demonstrated. No document or witness from the Excise
      Department attributes to him any role in the formulation or implementation of the
      New Excise Policy. His conduct must therefore be assessed strictly as that of a
      private individual operating in his personal and professional domain. As regards
      the allegation relating to meetings with industry stakeholders between February
      and August 2021, the prosecution material, even if taken at its highest, merely


                                       Page no. 10 of 48
      suggests that he sought feedback and support on the proposed excise policy from
      persons known to him in the industry. Such conduct, by itself, is neither illegal nor
      incriminating. At best, the prosecution relies upon the statement of PW-101; the
      remaining material is either hearsay or exculpatory. The statement of PW-101 is
      vague and devoid of particulars. It does not disclose any bribe demand, nor does it
      specify any policy clause allegedly sought to be altered. PW-101 states that no
      bribe was paid and that no consequence followed. His assertion that the final
      policy deviated from certain suggestions is unsupported by any concrete instance.
      Such vague assertions cannot sustain a charge. Even otherwise, there is no
      disclosure of “undue advantage” within the meaning of Sections 7 or 7A of the PC
      Act. At its highest, the material reflects a solicitation or discussion, which does
      not amount to an offence in law.
22.          It is further submitted that the allegations pertaining to meetings at Gauri
      Apartments and ITC Kohenoor, even if accepted in toto, indicate only that A-3
      attended meetings with private individuals in his personal capacity to explore
      possible business opportunities. The New Excise Policy had been placed in the
      public domain from 22.03.2021 onwards. There was no legal prohibition against
      such discussions. The version of the approver, PW-20, stands contradicted by his
      own subsequent statements as well as by the testimony of independent witnesses
      PW-1 and PW-2. The material, when read cumulatively, is exculpatory. Even
      assuming, without admitting, that a private negotiation occurred, the same
      remains a private arrangement unconnected with any public servant or public
      duty. No offence under the PC Act or IPC is thereby disclosed. With respect to the
      allegation of receipt of ₹20–30 crores through hawala, the prosecution material, at
      its highest, suggests receipt of money in his personal capacity without linkage to
      any public servant or official act. There is no presumption in law that such receipt
      was on behalf of another or for an improper purpose, and Section 20 of the PC Act
      is inapplicable. The allegation rests solely on the uncorroborated testimony of
      PW-20, which is inconsistent as to dates, quantum and number of transactions. No
      independent corroboration, including examination of the alleged hawala operator,
      has been adduced. Such infirm material does not even raise grave suspicion. The
      allegation that A-3 “directed” Pernod Ricard not to appoint Brindco, even at its
      highest, establishes only that Pernod Ricard officials interacted with him
      voluntarily as a private individual. His views were treated as personal opinions.


                                        Page no. 11 of 48
      No threat, consequence or coercion is alleged. The failure of negotiations between
      Pernod and Brindco arose from independent commercial considerations. This
      allegation is therefore misconceived.
23.          It is also submitted that in relation to the alleged influence in the grant of
      L-1 licence to Indospirits, the sole material is the statement of PW-20 claiming to
      have been informed by A-3 that he had spoken to the Excise Commissioner. This
      is hearsay. The Excise Commissioner (PW-74) denies any acquaintance or
      communication. At best, the prosecution suggests an untruth told to PW-20, which
      is neither incriminating nor legally relevant. No document or departmental
      witness attributes any role to A-3 in the grant of licence. The allegation regarding
      credit notes of ₹34.55 lakhs, even if accepted at face value, pertains to
      transactions between private entities. No public servant is involved and no official
      act is shown to have been influenced. Private commercial dealings do not attract
      Sections 7, 7A or 8 of the PC Act. The allegation again rests on uncorroborated
      approver testimony. Similarly, the allegation of transfer of ₹45.54 crores to Goa is
      unsupported by any material connecting A-3 with the alleged cash movement. The
      statements relied upon are either hearsay or silent as to his involvement. No
      public servant, official act or quid pro quo is identified. The essential ingredients
      of the alleged offences remain unestablished.
24.         It is finally urged that in the totality of circumstances, the prosecution case
      against A-3 rests on conjecture, uncorroborated approver testimony and private
      commercial interactions unconnected with any public duty. Permitting the
      prosecution to proceed on such tenuous material would subject him to a roving
      and vexatious trial. A-3 is therefore entitled to discharge in respect of the
      aforesaid allegations.


      (V)   Submissions by Ld. Counsels Sh. Sumer Singh Boparai, Sh. Surya Pratap
            Singh, Sh. Abhilash Kumar Pathak, Sh. Shubham Raj Anand and Sh.
            Sirhaan Seth, for A-4 Abhishek Boinpally :-
25.          It is submitted that the principal allegation sought to be advanced by the
      prosecution is that during 14.03.2021–17.03.2021 he played a conspiratorial role
      in the formulation of the excise policy. Beyond certain Call Detail Records, which
      admittedly do not contain call transcripts or tower-location particulars, the


                                        Page no. 12 of 48
      prosecution relies upon a purported 36-page printout stated to have been taken at
      Oberoi on 16.04.2021 (D-128), repeatedly cited as the sole corroborative material
      in the relevant paragraphs of the charge-sheets. The said allegation is ex facie
      unsustainable and stands contradicted by the prosecution’s own record. PW-71
      (Sh. C. Arvind Kumar, Secretary to A-8), in his statement u/s 164 CrPC (D-187),
      categorically states that on 18.03.2021, A-8 handed him a hard copy of the draft
      GoM report comprising 20–25 pages and directed him to have it typed with
      proper formatting and pagination. PW-71 further states that the document became
      38 pages only on 19.03.2021 at 10:30 PM upon completion of typing and
      formatting.
26.          It is also submitted that it is borne out from the record that three GoM
      reports were prepared at the relevant time: dated 15.03.2021 (24 pages); dated
      19.03.2021 (38 pages); and dated 22.03.2021 (49 pages). None of these
      corresponds to a 36-page document. The report dated 15.03.2021 comprised 24
      pages; the report dated 19.03.2021 expanded to 38 pages only on 19.03.2021 at
      10:30 PM; and the report dated 22.03.2021 comprised 49 pages. The attempt to
      build a theory of conspiracy on the basis of a purported 36-page printout allegedly
      taken on 16.03.2021 is therefore inherently self-contradictory. A document of 36
      pages, allegedly generated prior to the existence of the typed GoM draft, cannot
      reasonably be treated as the GoM report, particularly when the original hard copy
      itself was only 20–25 pages and expanded only upon typing on 19.03.2021 at
      10:30 PM. The allegation fails on the prosecution’s own showing. Further, with
      respect to the meeting alleged at Gauri Apartment on 21.05.2021, the prosecution
      contends that A-4, along with A-3, A-5 and A-11, attended a meeting where
      discussions allegedly took place regarding the liquor policy and modalities for
      payment of pecuniary advantage. The prosecution relies primarily upon PW-20
      (approver), besides PW-1 and PW-2.
27.          It is contended that, barring the uncorroborated version of PW-20, there is
      no independent material, oral or documentary, to support the prosecution
      narrative. On the contrary, a plain reading of the statement of PW-2 (Sikandar
      Mann) indicates that the meeting related to businessmen from the “South” who
      were unfamiliar with the functioning of retail zones in Delhi and were seeking
      information regarding their operation. PW-2 further states that certain
      employees/labourers were deputed to assist A-4 in operating retail zones and were

                                       Page no. 13 of 48
      later disengaged in February 2022. The statements of PW-1 and PW-2, read
      conjointly, do not disclose any incriminating discussion relating to formulation or
      tweaking of the excise policy, nor do they support any allegation of transfer of
      money in lieu of undue favour. Even on the prosecution’s own witnesses, the
      meeting does not establish the hatching of any conspiracy. In relation to the
      alleged meeting at ITC Kohinoor, Hyderabad during 18.06.2021–20.06.2021, the
      prosecution alleges that it was conspired to send ₹20–30 crores as “upfront
      money” in lieu of a favourable excise policy.
28.          It is also contended that the fulcrum of the prosecution’s case is that A-4
      was the key person responsible for transporting such upfront money from the
      “South” to PW-20. However, the prosecution itself has shifted the alleged
      quantum of “upfront money” across charge-sheets; 20–30 crores; 90–100 crores;
      44.54 crores, thereby demonstrating internal inconsistency. Further, PW-1
      admittedly travelled to Hyderabad but was asked to leave the room and is unaware
      of the contents of the alleged meeting. There is thus no independent witness
      corroborating PW-20. The alleged mechanism of transporting money, namely
      exchange of currency note numbers, was never followed, and no such currency
      notes were recovered from A-4 or PW-20. The allegation remains unsupported by
      material evidence. PW-20 further alleges that A-4 met PW-74 (Arava Gopi
      Krishna) at Oberoi; however, PW-74 categorically states that he does not know
      A-4 and never met him. The repeated improvements in PW-20’s statements, even
      after grant of pardon, indicate absence of true and full disclosure. Despite
      exhaustive investigation and multiple charge-sheets, not a single currency note
      has been recovered and no hawala operator has been identified in relation to the
      alleged June–July 2021 transactions. It is also significant that PW-20, in his first
      statement dated 07.09.2022 u/s 50 PMLA, expressly stated that he had no
      financial transaction with A-3, and thereafter altered his stand in successive
      statements. Conspiracy, in law, must precede the commission of the alleged
      offence. The prosecution’s own case is that the relevant tweaking of the definition
      of “related entity” occurred vide GoM Report dated 15.04.2021. On that premise,
      the alleged conspiracy to send “upfront money” during 18.06.2021–20.06.2021
      cannot logically be projected as the genesis of such tweaking. PW-226 (Raghav
      Magunta), projected as a prime witness, did not name A-4 in his earlier
      statements. Only after obtaining concession of bail did he introduce allegations of


                                       Page no. 14 of 48
      money being sent to Butchi Babu and A-4. While he specifies a date for allegedly
      giving money to A-11, qua A-4 he makes only a vague assertion that sometime in
      June A-4 contacted him to demand ₹15 crores as upfront money. PW-227 claims
      to have handed over ₹10 crores and ₹15 crores to an unknown person, yet fails to
      disclose identity, contact particulars, location or recognition of the alleged
      recipient. The statements of PW-195 (Ashok Kaushik), read with PW-20’s
      statement dated 23.04.2023, do not establish a reliable chain of movement of
      cash. PW-195, in his first statement dated 17.01.2023, does not attribute any
      incriminating act to A-4. It is only after about six months, in a subsequent
      statement dated 29.06.2023, that he alleges delivery of four bags to Vinod
      Chauhan at A-4’s instance. He further refers to deliveries to one Ashok Singh,
      who does not figure in the prosecution case as either accused or witness. Even in
      his statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C., he furnishes no crucial particulars. The alleged
      money trail remains speculative and unsupported.
29.          It is further submitted that with regard to the allegation of receipt of ₹3.85
      crores from Mootha Gautam (A-6), it is submitted that A-4 and A-6 had a pre-
      existing business relationship. In November 2020, A-4 advanced a friendly loan of
      ₹6.53 crores to A-6, of which approximately ₹2.80 crores remains outstanding;
      the amount of ₹3.85 crores was merely part-repayment of the said loan, as
      reflected in contemporaneous documents (D-50; D-89; PW-29). A-4 cannot be
      imputed with knowledge of the source from which A-6 arranged repayment. The
      transactions pre-date the alleged period of offence and bear no nexus to any
      alleged conspiracy. Similarly, the alleged transfers of ₹1.70 crores from M/s
      Indospirits to M/s APPL and M/s IAN bear no nexus to A-4. The record relied
      upon by the prosecution itself indicates that these amounts were paid towards a
      campaign. Without prejudice, the mere purchase of a trademark or logo does not,
      in law, translate into control over a company’s affairs or entitlement to its profits.
      In the absence of cogent material demonstrating beneficial ownership, de facto
      control, or entitlement to financial accruals, no adverse inference can be drawn
      against A-4. It is finally submitted that the prosecution’s case against A-4 rests on
      conjecture, internally inconsistent statements of accomplice witnesses, and an
      unsubstantiated money trail unsupported by recovery or independent
      corroboration. Even if the material is accepted at its highest, it does not disclose



                                        Page no. 15 of 48
      the essential ingredients of the alleged offences. A-4 is therefore entitled to
      discharge.

      Sharma, Ms. Aditi Singh, Sh. Aditya Narayan, Ms. Raksha Tripathi, Sh. Suyash
      Pandey, Sh. R.B. Siddhartha, Ms. Muskan Sharma, Sh. Yash Saxena, Sh. Samarth
      Panwar and Ms. Khushi Arora, for A-5 Arun Ramchandra Pillai :-
30.          It is submitted that the prosecution seeks framing of charge against A-5 u/s
      120-B IPC read with Sections 7, 7A and 8 of the PC Act, 1988. Even if the
      material on record is accepted at face value, the essential ingredients of the
      alleged offences are not made out against A-5. The prosecution has taken mutually
      inconsistent stands regarding the inception of the alleged conspiracy, alternately
      placing it in January–February 2021 and April 2021. Such shifting versions render
      the foundation of the prosecution case uncertain and legally unsustainable. The
      prosecution has sought to combine unrelated events such as policy formulation,
      alleged payments, grant of L-1 licence and election expenditure into a single
      narrative of conspiracy, despite these pertaining to different time periods, persons
      and transactions. In the absence of any meeting of minds or demonstrable nexus,
      such aggregation cannot constitute conspiracy. The reliance on Call Detail
      Records and cell-tower location data is misconceived. No subscriber records or
      foundational proof linking the data to A-5 prior to 24.01.2022 have been
      produced. Mere presence or proximity reflected in such data does not establish
      participation in a conspiracy. Further, certain electronic evidence is unsupported
      by certification u/s 65-B of the Evidence Act and is inadmissible.
31.          It is also submitted that the statements of PW-1, PW-2 and PW-20 contain
      material contradictions regarding the alleged meeting at Gauri Apartments and
      lack independent corroboration. They merely refer to discussions on liquor shop
      modalities and do not attribute any illegality to A-5. With respect to the alleged
      meetings at ITC Kohinoor, Hyderabad, and Hotel Taj Mansingh dated 20.09.2021,
      the statements relied upon do not disclose any illegal agreement or act involving
      A-5. No financial trail of ₹20–30 crores has been established, nor is there
      corroboration from intermediaries or supporting digital evidence. The allegation
      of A-5’s presence at Hotel Oberoi on 05.11.2021 appears only in a belated

                                       Page no. 16 of 48
      supplementary statement and finds no support in the initial statements, rendering
      it unreliable. Similarly, the allegation of threatening a witness at Le Meridien,
      Gurgaon on 08.11.2021 is unsupported by hotel records or identification and is
      admitted by the witness to be without personal knowledge. The financial
      transactions relied upon do not establish conspiracy. The alleged contribution of
      ₹2.90 crores to M/s Indospirits is shown to be in the nature of genuine loans,
      which were subsequently repaid. The alleged disproportionate profit arises from
      internal commercial arrangements and cannot be criminalised. The loan of ₹4.25
      crores from Mootha Gautam is supported by a Loan Agreement dated 18.02.2022,
      with repayment period extending up to 10.02.2025.
32.         It is argued that the prosecution has selectively arraigned A-5 while treating
      another similarly placed person as a witness, raising serious doubt on the fairness
      of the investigation. At the stage of framing of charge, the Court must determine
      whether the material discloses the essential ingredients of the offences and raises
      grave suspicion. The material relied upon is speculative, contradictory and
      uncorroborated, and does not give rise to any prima facie case against A-5.
      Accordingly, continuation of proceedings against Accused No. 5 would amount to
      an unwarranted trial in the absence of foundational material, and he is entitled to
      discharge.


      (VII) Submissions by Ld. Senior Advocate Ms. Maneka Guruswamy, Ld.
      Counsels Sh. Shivendra Dwivedi, Ms. Onmichon Ramrar, Sh. Lavkesh Bhambani,
      Ms. Bhumika Yadav and Sh. Anmol Gupta, for A-6 Mootha Gautam :-
33.          It is contended that A-6 is a media professional with over 24 years’
      experience. He acquired Andhra Prabha in 2002, incorporated Andhra Prabha
      Publications Ltd. (APPL) in 2005 as its Managing Director, and later expanded
      into electronic media by incorporating India Ahead News Pvt. Ltd. (IANPL) in
      2013. The English news channel “India Ahead” was launched in 2018 pursuant to
      valid MIB permissions and featured among the top English channels in 2019. At
      the outset, it is submitted that the prosecution material discloses no direct or
      indirect linkage between A-6 and the alleged Delhi Excise Policy offences. He has
      no association with the liquor trade and admittedly did not participate in any of
      the alleged conspiracy meetings at Gauri Apartment, ITC Kohinoor, Taj Hotel or


                                       Page no. 17 of 48
      elsewhere. The alleged motive attributed to him to manipulate excise policy is
      therefore unfounded.
34.          It is further contended that the prosecution primarily relies on monetary
      transactions between A-6 and co-accused A-4, A-5 and A-11. It is submitted that
      financial dealings, by themselves, do not constitute conspiracy. There is no
      material showing any meeting of minds, agreement, or act connecting such
      transactions to the alleged criminal design. The alleged presence of A-10 (Arjun
      Pandey) at certain meetings cannot implicate A-6 in the absence of evidence that
      A-6 instructed or authorised him. Similarly, the allegation concerning A-15
      (Arvind Kumar) is vague. Even assuming A-15 facilitated hawala transactions, the
      WhatsApp material does not show that A-6 had knowledge of or involvement in
      any such dealings, and their communications were routine employer–employee
      exchanges. The attempt to link A-6 to the offence rests on bank transactions with
      A-4, A-5 and A-11. The prosecution has not demonstrated how these are
      connected to any excise policy manipulation or proceeds thereof. The record
      shows that A-6’s businesses were under financial distress due to an investor
      (PW-13) withdrawing, leading to civil disputes. Consequently, he raised funds
      from friends and family. During 2021–2022, unsecured loans aggregating about
      ₹26.82 crores were received. Loans raised to sustain a failing business cannot,
      absent linkage to conspiracy, justify framing of charge. Regarding A-4, both knew
      each other since 2012. A-6 received hand loans totalling ₹6.53 crores from
      October 2020, prior to the alleged conspiracy period. As security, APPL assigned
      the “India Ahead” trademark to A-4 for ₹1.30 crores by registered deed dated
      10.06.2022. A-4 and A-6 also jointly acquired ZNPL (having MIB licence) for
      ₹5.05 crores, supported by statutory approvals and bank records. These are
      legitimate commercial transactions and pre-date the alleged conspiratorial
      meetings.
35.         It is also contended that with respect to A-5, A-6 took a loan of ₹4.75 crores
      on 10.02.2022, reduced into a stamped loan agreement dated 18.02.2022.
      Objections raised by the prosecution regarding non-registration, witnesses, and
      same-day transfer to A-4 are legally untenable, as unsecured loan agreements need
      not be registered, witnesses need only attest execution, and the transfer was part-
      repayment of A-4’s earlier loan towards ZNPL acquisition. Further, as regards
      A-11, A-6 took loans of ₹30 lakhs and ₹70 lakhs in April–May 2021, fully repaid

                                       Page no. 18 of 48
      by September 2021. The prosecution has omitted pages showing receipt entries
      and relies only on repayments. Alleged transfers from A-4 to A-11 are based on
      conjecture, whereas repayments were from pooled funds. The proposed marketing
      campaign for Indospirits was a legitimate commercial proposal similar to past
      assignments for GoDaddy and Dream11. Advances of ₹1 crore and ₹70 lakhs
      were paid and recorded as “Advance” in accounts. The campaign failed only due
      to subsequent arraignment of A-5. Absence of a formal agreement does not render
      the transaction fictitious. Even on a face-value reading, the ingredients of Sections
      7A and 8 of the PC Act are not satisfied. There is no allegation that A-6 sought
      undue advantage, dealt in liquor business, influenced any public servant, or
      handled hawala money. All transactions are through banking channels and prima
      facie commercial. A-6 cannot be charged u/s 120-B IPC merely due to financial
      dealings with co-accused, absent evidence of unlawful intent or participation in
      any conspiracy. There is no motive, no nexus with excise policy, and no material
      showing direction, knowledge or participation. Accordingly, even if the
      prosecution case is accepted at its highest, no grave suspicion arises against A-6,
      and he is entitled to discharge.


      (VIII) Submissions by Ld. Counsels Sh. Dhruv Gupta, Sh. Anubhav Garg and Sh.
                 Yash Raj Mehran, for A-7 Sameer Mahandru :-

36.         It is submitted that the allegation of payment of ₹30 lakhs by A-7 to A-2
      does not disclose a prima facie offence u/s 8 of the PC Act. The allegation rests
      solely on the fourth statement of PW-20 dated 27.10.2022 and is purely hearsay,
      lacking particulars of time, place, manner or mode. PW-23 has stated that even the
      presence of A-7 and PW-20 near Khan Market cannot be ascertained. There is no
      corroboration by way of CDRs, electronic trail, recovery or independent
      witnesses, nor any allegation of inducement or demand. It is further submitted that
      A-2 was not the approving authority for the L-1 licence. As per PW-20’s
      statement u/s 164 CrPC, the alleged advance bribe had already been paid between
      July and September 2021, rendering any further payment by A-7 inherently
      implausible. Even in PW-20’s Section 164 CrPC statement dated 30.09.2022, no
      allegation of payment by A-7 is made. A new allegation of payment of ₹3 crores
      by A-7, introduced in PW-20’s seventh statement dated 17.10.2023 after grant of


                                        Page no. 19 of 48
      pardon, does not form part of any charge-sheet. Raman Chawla and Narender
      Bhaskar are un-relied witnesses, Sarvesh Mishra has not been examined, and
      Sanjay Singh is not an accused. The prosecution has thus not pursued this version.
      In any case, statements of PW-20 or PW-226, being of an approver/co-accused,
      are inadmissible against A-7. There is no prima facie material to show that A-7
      exercised any influence over a public servant. PW-74 has denied any
      communication with A-3 or PW-20. Had influence been exercised, deficiency
      memoranda and show-cause notices would not have been issued to M/s IMPL, nor
      would its licence application have been withdrawn. The Excise Department also
      forwarded the complaint against M/s Khao Gali Restaurants Pvt. Ltd. to the
      Income Tax Department. PW-272 corroborates this position. The allegation that
      an unregistered JV was taken on record in violation of the New Excise Policy is
      misconceived. The JV Agreement of M/s IS was duly attested and registration was
      not mandatory, as stated by PW-18. Another licensee, M/s KSJM LLP, was
      granted licence on the basis of an unregistered deed, yet is not an accused,
      rendering the allegation selective.
37.          It is also argued that the claim that only M/s IS was granted an L-1 licence
      on 05.11.2021 is incorrect. PW-7 has stated that licences were also granted on the
      same date to M/s Rohan Transport and M/s Dewan Spirits. The WhatsApp-based
      allegation is further diluted as the phones of PW-20 and A-1, A-2 and A-7 are all
      un-relied. There is no material to show pressure in appointment of M/s IS as
      distributor of M/s PRI. PW-17 has stated that M/s IS was chosen on commercial
      parameters after Brindco declined exclusivity, that A-3 did not suggest any name,
      and that due diligence was conducted through PwC. A-7’s commercial association
      with M/s PRI since 2015 negates any impropriety. The allegation of EMD
      funding/cross-funding is unsustainable. Corporate guarantees and inter-corporate
      loans were extended to multiple entities, none of whom are accused. PW-226 has
      described these as legitimate loans repaid with interest. A-7 was neither
      shareholder nor director in M/s KG or M/s Bubbly. Cartelisation is not an offence
      under the PC Act. The allegation regarding outstanding retail zone dues is
      irrelevant to A-7. M/s IS had dues of over ₹150 crores from several licensees, and
      policy revocation, losses and NCLT proceedings explain non-recovery. There is
      no material to connect A-7 with policy formulation or conspiracy u/s 120-B IPC.
      The prosecution confines policy-related meetings to January–June 2021 involving


                                       Page no. 20 of 48
      other accused. A-7 is not alleged to have participated in any such meeting.
      Subsequent commercial acts cannot attract criminal liability.
38.         Lastly, it is contended that the allegation of recoupment of ₹29.29 crores is
      misconceived. The amount represents a running account of Accused No. 5 with
      M/s IS and includes business and personal expenses. The furnishing of a personal
      security cheque of ₹32.5 crores establishes a commercial arrangement. There is
      no material linking A-7 to any recoupment for the alleged “South Group”. A-7 is
      neither a public servant nor an intermediary, and no offence u/s s 7, 7A or 8 of the
      PC Act is made out even prima facie. Accordingly, even if the prosecution case is
      accepted at its highest, no grave suspicion arises against A-7, and he is entitled to
      discharge.


      (IX) Submissions by Ld. Senior Advocate Ms. Rebecca John, Ld. Counsels Sh.
           Vivek Jain, Sh. Sadiq Noor, Sh. Rohit Nair and Mohd. Irshad, for A-8
           Manish Sisodia :-

39.          It is submitted that the prosecution case rests on the erroneous premise that
      the Excise Policy 2021–22 was manipulated to favour a particular group. The
      record, however, shows that the policy was the outcome of a structured,
      consultative and inter-departmental process aimed at reforming an admittedly
      flawed earlier regime. Under the previous framework, manufacturers could
      operate as wholesalers and, through proxy arrangements, even as retailers, with
      minimal entry barriers and no effective price control. This vertical integration led
      to monopolistic conditions and profit margins up to 65%, necessitating reform.
      The new policy was formulated through constitution of an expert body, public
      consultation, deliberations of the Group of Ministers, inter-departmental scrutiny
      (Excise, Planning, Law and Finance), Cabinet consideration and reference to the
      Hon’ble Lieutenant Governor. The Ravi Dhawan Committee highlighted
      distortions in the earlier regime and recommended delinking manufacturers from
      wholesale operations; its recommendations were advisory.
40.          It is contended that the allegation of an abrupt increase in profit margin
      from 5% to 12% is misconceived. GoM reports dated 15.03.2021, 19.03.2021 and
      22.03.2021 show that drafting evolved through discussions and multiple
      iterations. The 5% figure was only a minimum suggestion without an upper cap.

                                        Page no. 21 of 48
      The final 12% cap was fixed after factoring substantially higher obligations on
      wholesalers, including ₹5 crore annual licence fee, testing labs, CCTV, anti-
      brand-pushing measures, warehousing norms and enhanced operational costs.
      Even as per the Ravi Dhawan Committee, the earlier regime enabled margins up
      to 65%; thus, the 12% cap restricted profitability rather than expanding it. The
      policy introduced consumer safeguards such as lowest ex-distillery pricing,
      mandatory pass-through of reductions, barcoding and competitive zoning through
      e-tendering into 32 retail zones. Cabinet Note dated 16.04.2021 and inter-
      departmental correspondence reflect collective decision-making. The policy was
      forwarded to the Hon’ble LG under Article 239AA(4); his suggestions were
      incorporated and approved. Official file notings, proved by LG Secretariat
      officers, show institutional participation and attract presumption of regularity
      under Section 35 of the Evidence Act.
41.          It is also contended that structurally, the policy separated manufacturers,
      wholesalers and retailers, barred cross-holding, imposed strict eligibility and anti-
      cartelisation measures, and replaced excise-duty driven revenue with high upfront
      licence fees. The earlier 5% margin and the later 12% cap operated in entirely
      different ecosystems and are not comparable. Retail pricing was governed by
      statutory rules; regulated discounts were permitted in consumer interest and later
      rationalised. Prosecution witnesses (PW-110 and PW-111) themselves indicate
      that increased landed costs reduced effective margins, especially in beer
      distribution.
42.         A substantial part of the prosecution case challenges the wisdom of the
      policy. It is settled that fiscal and economic policy lies within executive discretion
      and cannot be criminalised absent demonstrable harm to public interest, as held in
      State of Madhya Pradesh v. Sheetla Sahai, Small Scale Industrial Manufacturers
      Association v. Union of India, Parag Ice & Oil Mills v. Union of India and Vivek
      Narayan Sharma v. Union of India. The allegation that public consultation was
      manipulated through six emails out of over 14,000 is untenable. There is no
      evidence that these influenced the policy, no recovery of any handwritten note,
      and no proof of any meeting between A-8 and the alleged sender. The claim of
      suppression of legal opinions is contradicted by record, which shows that A-8
      directed all viewpoints to be placed before the Cabinet. GoM minutes of February
      2021 reflect detailed deliberations, corroborated by witnesses. The “upfront bribe”

                                        Page no. 22 of 48
      allegation fails on timeline: the alleged money trail begins months after policy
      decisions. There is no recovery from A-8, no evidence of demand, and no proof of
      receipt.
43.          It is argued that the alleged nexus with Vijay Nair is unsupported; mere
      proximity of offices cannot establish conspiracy. There is no recovery of the
      alleged 36-page document or any device linking it to A-8, and even the
      prosecution’s WhatsApp material does not show knowledge of a 12% margin by
      alleged beneficiaries. Regarding Indospirits, the initial statement of the concerned
      officer made no allegation against A-8. Even subsequent statements only attribute
      a direction to process the file “as per rules”. The main charge-sheet attributes
      alleged bribery to other officials; there is no basis to implicate A-8. In sum, there
      is no material showing demand, receipt or facilitation of illegal gratification by
      A-8. The prosecution seeks to criminalise a policy decision without proving harm
      to public interest or the essential ingredients of the offences. No case is made out
      against A-8.


      (X)   Submissions by Ld. Counsels Sh. Adit S. Pujari, Sh. Shaswat Sarin and Sh.
            Shaurya Mittal and Ms. Dhanya Visweswaran, for A-9 Amandeep Singh
            Dhall :-
44.          It is submitted that the allegations concerning issuance of credit notes by
      A-9 are wholly misconceived in fact and law. When examined in their proper
      commercial and contractual context, the material on record discloses no illegality
      or criminality. Issuance of credit notes is a well-recognised industry practice in the
      liquor trade, as affirmed by PW-107, PW-108, PW-109, PW-110, PW-111,
      PW-112, PW-113, PW-114 and PW-119. Performance-linked incentive schemes
      are routinely implemented through credit notes to promote sales and market share.
      In the present case, such schemes were introduced and credit notes issued strictly
      in furtherance thereof. The prosecution’s own documents (D-131 and D-175)
      demonstrate a substantial increase in sales of UBL and USL products during the
      relevant period, thereby negating the theory that incentives did not result in higher
      sales.
45.         It is also submitted that even for high-selling brands, manufacturers
      represented by BSPL enhanced incentives. PW-114 has stated that BSPL was


                                        Page no. 23 of 48
      never prohibited from issuing credit notes from its own repository. In respect of
      USL, the agreement dated 23.05.2022 contains no bar on non-manufacturer-
      backed credit notes, and PW-112 has confirmed absence of prohibition. Annexure
      P-1 (D-185) reflects corresponding sales growth. Similarly, the UBL agreement
      dated 23.09.2022 contains no restriction on issuance of credit notes from
      distributor margins; rather, it obliges the distributor to promote and develop the
      market. Annexure P-2 (D-185) shows comparative price parameters across states.
      In practice, incentive schemes were often conveyed orally by manufacturers, as
      borne out by PW-109 and PW-111. Prior written approval, even if mentioned in
      agreements, was not strictly adhered to, and emails show that schemes were
      formalised post-implementation. This accepted commercial conduct negatives any
      suggestion of clandestine or unauthorised activity by BSPL. The prosecution
      relies on witnesses who were not involved in commercial negotiations, while the
      person handling such matters, Mr. Arvind Padhi, has not been examined. The Sula
      agreement dated 01.11.2021 also does not prohibit issuance of credit notes. The
      clause relied upon by the prosecution merely contemplates reimbursement of
      approved discounts and does not bar incentives from distributor margins. The
      allegation of recoupment by the so-called “South Group” is untenable. Retailer
      accounts were reconciled on T+15/T+30 terms and fully settled. No financial trail
      supports recoupment through credit notes, and BSPL’s financial statements
      (D-200) provide no commercial rationale for such conduct. PW-17, PW-113 and
      PW-114 show that manufacturers were keen to appoint BSPL due to its standing
      and compliance record. The suggestion that both UBL and Pernod Ricard would
      simultaneously appoint BSPL is incorrect. The proforma agreement clause in
      D-175 itself shows Pernod would not have entered into an arrangement if a
      binding contract with USL already existed.
46.          It is argued that BSPL, holding established brands such as Kingfisher,
      McDowell No.1, Royal Challenger, Black Dog and Johnnie Walker, would
      naturally benefit commercially irrespective of policy changes. It made no
      representation to the Ravi Dhawan Committee and did not participate in policy-
      related meetings. Under the earlier policy, commercial risks lay largely with
      manufacturers; under the new policy, risks shifted to BSPL as L-1 licensee.
      Higher margins were commercially justified to offset these additional liabilities,
      and the prosecution has undertaken no comparative margin analysis. The


                                      Page no. 24 of 48
      allegation relating to credit notes to Ace Finance and alleged cash routing is
      unsupported. Monthly reconciliations were undertaken and dues fully recovered.
      Neither BSPL’s nor Ace Finance’s books show entries corresponding to alleged
      cash payments. BSPL has no employee named Harjinder, and witness statements
      are inconsistent on the identity of the alleged collector. The Ace Finance ledger
      (D-184) shows cash withdrawals under “Special Expenses” but does not link them
      to BSPL credit notes. The one-page ledger (D-183) is inconsistent with the
      broader record. There is no evidence of any instruction by BSPL to withdraw
      cash, and any acts of Ace Finance cannot be imputed to BSPL absent proof of
      direction or conspiracy. On the contrary, statements indicate that alleged cash
      payments, if any, related to the personal licensing issues of Dinesh Arora. Income
      Tax proceedings against Ace Finance do not establish any nexus with BSPL or
      A-9.
47.         In the totality of circumstances, it is submitted that the prosecution material
      discloses no criminal intent, conspiracy or unlawful gain on the part of A-9.
      Issuance of credit notes was a commercially rational and industry-recognised
      practice resulting in demonstrable sales growth. The allegations rest on conjecture
      and selective reading of evidence and do not satisfy even the threshold of grave
      suspicion. Accordingly, no case is made out against A-9.


      (XI) Submissions by Ld. Senior Advocate Sh. Shadan Farasat, Ld. Counsels Sh.
           Shivendra Dwivedi, Ms. Varisha Sharma and Ms. Onmichon Ramrar, for
           A-10 Arjun Pandey :-
48.          It is contended that the FIR dated 17.08.2022 alleges that he collected ₹2–4
      crores from A-7 on behalf of A-3. However, this allegation is not consistently
      reiterated or substantiated in any of the five charge-sheets. On the contrary, in his
      further statement dated 17.10.2024, PW-20 (approver) stated that ₹1 crore was
      routed through Raman Chawla to Sarvesh Mishra and ₹2 crores were directly
      handed over to PW-20 by A-7 and his staff, which is inconsistent with the FIR
      version and negates the role attributed to A-10. The prosecution alleges that A-10
      was present with A-3 at a meeting with PW-101 Suresh Menon on 01.03.2021 at
      Hotel Taj, where illegal gratification was allegedly demanded. However,
      PW-101’s statement records that A-10 remained silent, and PW-102 and PW-103
      do not even refer to him. Similarly, with respect to the alleged meeting at Gauri

                                        Page no. 25 of 48
      Apartment on 21.05.2021, PW-1 and PW-2 state that A-10 did not speak and was
      only a silent spectator. The statement of approver PW-20 dated 21.09.2022 also
      attributes no overt act to him, and none of PW-20’s subsequent statements or his
      statement u/s 164 CrPC implicate A-10.
49.          It is also contended that in the first supplementary charge-sheet, reliance is
      placed on his designation as President (Sales & Marketing) of India Ahead News
      and his alleged presence at various meetings. It is submitted that he was appointed
      on 11.06.2020, prior to the constitution of the Ravi Dhawan Committee and prior
      to the Excise Policy framework, and his role was confined to revenue generation
      through advertisements and sponsorships. Even in the prosecution material, he is
      consistently described as a silent spectator. Allegations regarding meetings at
      Hotel Oberoi and Hotel Lodhi are unsupported by any specific statement or
      documentary evidence. As regards credit notes, PW-20 alleges that he and A-10
      contacted A-9. This allegation is not repeated in PW-20’s other statements or his
      statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C. and finds no independent corroboration, except in the
      statement of PW-226 Raghav Magunta dated 12.12.2023. An uncorroborated
      approver version, especially with improvements, cannot be the sole basis for
      framing charge. The prosecution relies on transfers of ₹70 lakhs from M/s Indo
      Spirits to India Ahead News Ltd. and ₹1 crore to Andhra Prabha Publications
      Ltd., and characterises his salary of ₹5 lakhs per month as “hefty”. There is no
      material to show that A-10 had any role in or knowledge of these transfers. Mere
      employment in a recipient company cannot establish conspiracy. His salary,
      considering his senior position and experience, cannot give rise to any criminal
      inference.
50.         It is further argued that the WhatsApp chats involving Devang Solanki and
      A-15 do not incriminate A-10. Routine professional interaction does not establish
      conspiracy. The allegation that he facilitated employment of PW-195 Ashok
      Kumar Kaushik is also legally neutral, there being no material to show knowledge
      or intent to further any illegal design. PW-226 further alleges that credit notes
      worth ₹1 crore were received on the instructions of A-10; this assertion is
      uncorroborated by any independent evidence.
51.         At the stage of charge, it is submitted that where only suspicion and not
      grave suspicion arises, the view favourable to the accused must prevail. The case
      against A-10 rests substantially on uncorroborated and inconsistent approver

                                        Page no. 26 of 48
      statements. Mere presence at meetings or being a silent spectator does not satisfy
      the ingredients of conspiracy u/s 120-B IPC, which requires an agreement and
      meeting of minds. There is no overt act attributed to A-10, no material showing
      any benefit to him, and no allegation of his contact with any public servant. The
      material, taken cumulatively, does not disclose any prima facie case against A-10.


      (XII) Submissions by Ld. Senior Advocate Sh. Arshdeep Singh Khurana, Ld.
            Counsels Sh. Abhishek Singh, Sh. Talib Mustafa, Sh. Anmol Aggarwal, Sh.
            Ketan Kumar Roy, Sh. Vishvendra Tomar, Sh. Harsh Srivastava, Ms.
            Dikksha Ramnani and Sh. Chetan Nagpal, for A-11 Butchibabu Gorantla :-

52.          It is submitted that the prosecution alleges that A-11 attended certain
      meetings between March and September 2021 at Hotel Oberoi, Gauri Apartments,
      ITC Kohinoor (Hyderabad) and Hotel Taj, Delhi. Regarding Hotel Oberoi (14–
      17.03.2021), the allegation rests solely on presence. No witness states that any
      discussion on Excise Policy, demand of bribe or unlawful act took place involving
      A-11. The allegation that 36 pages of policy were printed from the hotel is
      unsupported—no document, CCTV footage, forensic link, receipt or electronic
      trail connects him with such activity. PW-71 and PW-72 have stated that the
      policy comprised only 25–26 pages, rendering the allegation improbable. As to
      Gauri Apartments and ITC Kohinoor, the statements of PW-20, PW-1 and PW-2 at
      best show that A-11 spoke on financial and market aspects. None attributes to him
      any role in policy formulation, demand or payment of bribe, influencing public
      servants, or unlawful decision-making. The Hotel Taj meeting (20.09.2021)
      allegedly related to appointment of M/s Indo Spirits as wholesaler for M/s Pernod
      Ricard. A-11 had no role in such appointment, which was a purely commercial
      decision. He was neither beneficiary nor stakeholder.
53.          It is further submitted that the allegation of demand of ₹50 crores or
      facilitation of ₹10 crores (Chennai) rests primarily on the statement of Raghav
      Magunta dated 12.12.2023, recorded when he was an accused and prior to grant
      of pardon. Such statement cannot retrospectively become approver evidence.
      There is no independent corroboration. PW-227 (Gopi Kumaran) does not know
      the recipient, address or place of delivery. No recovery, financial trail, document
      or electronic evidence connects A-11 to any payment. Seized devices yielded

                                       Page no. 27 of 48
      nothing incriminating. Lawful loan transactions of ₹1 crore with Mootha
      Gowtham (April/May 2021) are sought to be portrayed as tainted. These pre-date
      the alleged offence period. Bank statements showing payment and repayment
      were produced and placed on record. The prosecution itself alleges generation of
      proceeds of crime only after November 2021, yet has relegated exculpatory
      material to unrelied documents.
54.          It is argued that the allegation that A-11 was partner/signatory to a Joint
      Venture Agreement with IMPL is unsustainable. No document bearing his
      signature has been produced. The alleged JV Agreement shows inconsistencies in
      stamp date (31.03.2021), agreement date (01.09.2021) and notarisation date
      (14.10.2021). The original has not been seized; signatures differ; MCA records do
      not show him as shareholder, director or KMP; CDRs do not place him in Delhi
      on the notarisation date; the notary has not been examined and no notarial register
      seized. The WhatsApp chats allegedly extracted from his device are unsupported
      by CFSL report, hash value or Section 65B certificate. Source is unclear (“Web”
      shown), extraction was not as per protocol, and there was unexplained delay in
      FSL dispatch. In any event, the chats contain no reference to bribe, illegal
      gratification or public servants, and none of the discussed provisions were
      implemented.
55.          It is also argued that the property discussion alleged as recoupment of ₹14
      crores is misconceived. The prosecution’s own case concerns wholesalers,
      whereas the concerned party was a retailer. Chats with Madhu Gorla show no
      nexus with the alleged conspiracy. Price escalation reflects market appreciation
      (₹14 crores in 2019 to ₹28 crores in 2021; PW-226 states ₹16 crores in 2019). No
      agreement materialised and no benefit accrued. A-11 merely circulated templates
      and did not negotiate or finalise any transaction. Even if the prosecution material
      is taken at its highest, A-11 is not shown to be investor, licensee, policy influencer
      or beneficiary. No motive, gain, demand or acceptance of bribe is alleged. No
      corrupt arrangement with any public servant is shown. Essential ingredients of
      conspiracy and offences under the PC Act are absent. The case rests on conjecture,
      uncorroborated statements and procedurally defective electronic material. There is
      no material showing agreement, corrupt intent, unlawful gain or participation in
      any illegal act. No grave suspicion arises against A-11. Accordingly, A-11 is
      entitled to discharge.

      (XIII) Submissions by Ld. Counsels Sh. Rajat Bhardwaj and Sh. Dushyant
            Chaudhary, for A-12 Rajesh Joshi :-

56.          It is contended that A-12 was neither named in the FIR dated 17.08.2022
      nor arraigned in the main charge-sheet dated 24.11.2022 or the supplementary
      charge-sheet dated 25.04.2023. He has been implicated for the first time in the
      Second Supplementary Charge-sheet dated 08.07.2023, without any fresh
      incriminating material. The very same material, on which earlier charge-sheets
      were filed without arraigning him, has now been relied upon. Such belated
      implication, founded on conjecture and not on new evidence, is impermissible in
      criminal law. As per the prosecution’s own case, he is the Director of M/s Chariot
      Productions Media Pvt. Ltd., a company engaged in providing media and
      campaign-related services in the ordinary course of business. The only allegation
      pertains to alleged movement of certain funds. There is no allegation that he
      participated in any policy-related meeting, had knowledge of generation of
      alleged proceeds of crime, or committed any specific overt act. He is also not
      alleged to be a beneficiary of any alleged illegal amount. In the absence of a
      defined role and mens rea, no criminal liability can be fastened upon him.
57.          It is further contended that the investigation, insofar as it concerns him,
      reflects a pre-determined approach. The statements relied upon contain material
      variations and improvements, and the allegations regarding his directorship and
      supposed involvement in money laundering for campaign purposes are
      unsupported by substantive evidence. The prosecution mainly relies on statements
      of persons who are admitted participants in alleged hawala transactions but have
      not been arraigned as accused and thus stand on the footing of accomplices. It is
      settled law that uncorroborated accomplice testimony cannot form the basis even
      for framing of charge unless supported by independent material. In the present
      case, there is no independent admissible evidence connecting him with any
      offence so as to raise even a strong suspicion.
58.          It is also contended that M/s Chariot Productions Media Pvt. Ltd. has an
      established history of providing media and campaign services such as event
      management, surveys and vendor coordination. Engagement of vendors is routine
      industry practice. PW-164 has stated that the Goa premises were rented only from
      January 2020 to January 2021. PW-169 has clarified that salary transfers related

                                      Page no. 29 of 48
      only to specific months of 2020 and were later discontinued. Vendor witnesses
      (PW-174 to PW-179) have deposed that payments were made against services
      rendered and duly accounted. The work value and payments on record show
      transparent commercial transactions, with no link to any alleged proceeds of
      crime.
59.           It is argued that the allegation of receipt of part of the alleged upfront
      money rests solely on PW-20 (approver). Even in his earliest statement, A-12 was
      not named. In the statement u/s 164 CrPC, reference is made to “Rajesh Sharma”
      and not to A-12. There is no independent statement or documentary trail showing
      that he received any amount. The version that he handled cash is wholly
      uncorroborated. In view of the inconsistencies in PW-20’s statements and lack of
      corroboration, no inference of conspiracy can be drawn. Regarding alleged cash
      transfers through angadia channels, the statements of PW-183 suffer from
      contradictions as to dates, amounts and instances. Statements under Sections 161
      and 164 CrPC show material shifts without explanation. Importantly, none of
      these statements connect the alleged transfers to the Excise Policy or to A-12. As
      to alleged distribution of cash to vendors, the vendors have categorically stated
      that payments were made for legitimate services. Purchase orders, invoices and
      receipts are on record. The quantum of cash reflected is minimal compared to total
      work and is duly accounted. The prosecution’s own documents show transactions
      through normal commercial channels, with no material indicating circulation of
      illicit funds.
60.           It is submitted that no material discloses any agreement or meeting of minds
      involving A-12. Mere association with a service-providing company cannot
      amount to criminal conspiracy. The essential ingredients of Section 120-B IPC,
      namely a prior agreement to commit an illegal act, are wholly absent. No witness
      attributes to him any role in the formulation or implementation of the Excise
      Policy, nor is any overt act or criminal intent shown. At the stage of framing of
      charge, the Court must see whether the material discloses the essential ingredients
      of the alleged offences and raises a strong suspicion. Even if taken at its highest,
      the material does not disclose a prima facie case against A-12. The prosecution
      case rests on conjecture, presumptions and impermissible inference of vicarious
      liability, without evidence of demand, receipt, handling of illegal gratification, or
      participation in conspiracy. Continuation of proceedings in these circumstances

                                        Page no. 30 of 48
      would subject him to a speculative and unwarranted trial. He is therefore entitled
      to be discharged.


      (XIV) & (XV)      Submissions by Ld. Counsels Sh. Rajat Bhardwaj and Sh.
                        Dushyant Chaudhary, for A-13 Damodar Prasad Sharma and
                        A-14 Prince Kumar :-


61.          It is contended that A-13 and A-14 were neither named in the FIR dated
      17.08.2022 nor arrayed in the main charge-sheet dated 24.11.2022 or the first
      supplementary charge-sheet dated 25.04.2023. They have been implicated for the
      first time only in the second supplementary charge-sheet dated 08.07.2023,
      without any fresh incriminating material. The implication is based on the same
      material earlier found insufficient, rendering the belated arraignment legally
      unsustainable. As per the prosecution itself, A-13 and A-14 were employees of
      M/s Chariot Media Productions, engaged in media and advertisement services in
      the ordinary course of business. The only allegation is of alleged movement of
      funds. It is not alleged that they participated in any Excise Policy meeting, had
      knowledge of generation of proceeds of crime, committed any overt act, or were
      beneficiaries of any alleged illegal money. In the absence of a defined role and
      mens rea, criminal liability cannot be inferred.
62.         It is also contended that the allegation against A-13 rests mainly on
      statements of PW-183 and PW-171. There is no independent or documentary
      evidence linking him to any offence or money trail. The alleged transfer of funds
      from Delhi to Goa is unsupported by material showing origin, source, delivery or
      destination of funds, or any nexus with proceeds of crime under the Excise Policy.
      The money trail is broken and unestablished. The investigation reflects a
      predetermined approach, with material inconsistencies and improvements in
      statements. The prosecution relies primarily on statements of persons admittedly
      involved in hawala transactions, who in law are accomplices. It is settled that
      uncorroborated accomplice testimony cannot form the basis even for framing of
      charge. No independent admissible corroboration exists.
63.        It is argued that the allegation of hawala payment to PW-171 ( ₹2.45 lakhs
      and ₹4.25 lakhs) is founded on statements of PW-172 and PW-173. Their

                                      Page no. 31 of 48
      statements are identically structured, raising doubts about authenticity. No hawala
      operator identifies A-13 by full particulars or links him through mobile numbers
      or other identifiers. The alleged receipts (D-218 and D-219) do not mention the
      sender’s name or connect them to A-13. The alleged Mumbai transactions show
      no linkage to Goa, to vendors, or to any Excise Policy activity. Regarding the
      allegation of cash of ₹11.93 crores allegedly handled by Rajesh Joshi as per
      PW-183, the statements under Sections 161 and 164 CrPC are materially
      inconsistent as to period and amount (6–7 crores, then 4–5 crores, and later a new
      instance of ₹5 crores). These shifting versions, absence of specificity in earlier
      statements, and unexplained introduction of new details seriously undermine
      credibility. Further, none of these statements assert any connection of the funds
      with the Excise Policy or proceeds of crime. As regards A-14, the allegation of
      receipt of ₹16,08,000 via hawala at Goa rests solely on PW-180. There is no
      material to show knowledge of the alleged source of funds or any nexus with an
      offence. There is no independent corroboration regarding delivery, utilisation or
      onward movement of funds. Apart from PW-180’s statements dated 04.05.2023
      and 26.06.2023, no witness or document attributes any role to A-14.
64.           It is submitted that no material discloses any agreement or meeting of minds
      involving Accused Nos. 13 and 14 so as to attract Section 120-B IPC. Mere
      employment or peripheral association cannot substitute proof of conspiracy. Even
      witnesses referring to hawala transactions do not attribute to them any role in
      collection, transportation or distribution of funds. At the stage of framing of
      charge, the Court must see whether the material discloses essential ingredients of
      the offences and raises grave suspicion. Even if taken at face value, the
      prosecution material does not disclose a prima facie case against Accused Nos. 13
      and 14. The case rests on conjecture and uncorroborated statements, without proof
      of demand, receipt, handling of illegal gratification, or participation in conspiracy.
      It is, therefore, respectfully prayed that A-13 and A-14 be discharged.


      (XVI) Submissions by Ld. Counsels Sh. Rajat Bhardwaj and Sh. Dushyant
           Chaudhary, for A-15 Arvind Kumar Singh :-
65.          It is contended that A-15 was not named in the FIR dated 17.08.2022, nor
      was he arrayed as an accused in the main charge-sheet dated 24.11.2022 or the
      first supplementary charge-sheet dated 25.04.2023. He was implicated for the first

                                        Page no. 32 of 48
      time only in the second supplementary charge-sheet dated 08.07.2023. No fresh
      material has been shown to have emerged in the interregnum. His belated
      arraignment on the basis of material earlier considered insufficient renders the
      prosecution against him unsustainable. As per the prosecution record, A-15 is an
      employee of India Ahead News, a national news channel. The sole allegation is of
      alleged involvement in movement of funds. There is no allegation that he
      participated in any Excise Policy meeting, influenced any public servant,
      negotiated or received illegal gratification, or had knowledge of any alleged
      proceeds of crime. In the absence of a defined role, criminal liability cannot be
      presumed. The investigation rests on inferences rather than substantive evidence.
      The statements relied upon suffer from contradictions and material improvements.
      The allegation that A-15 laundered funds for any political campaign merely
      because of his employment lacks evidentiary foundation. The case against A-15
      rests primarily on statements of persons admittedly engaged in hawala
      transactions, who are accomplices in law. In the absence of independent
      corroboration on material particulars, such statements cannot form the basis even
      for framing of charge. No such admissible corroboration exists. The allegation
      that A-15 provided cash in Delhi to PW-191 (Devang Solanki) for onward hawala
      transfer of ₹7,10,92,500/- to A-16 in Goa between 04.01.2022 and 10.01.2022
      through PW-180 (Sagar Kumar Patel of M/s R. Kantilal Finance) is unsupported.
      PW-180’s earliest statement dated 04.05.2023 records transactions between
      21.06.2021 and 10.01.2022 aggregating to ₹15,50,10,500/-, without any reference
      to October or November 2021 transactions. In a later statement dated 25.05.2023,
      he introduced 26 transactions of November 2021 amounting to ₹27 crores, which
      were absent earlier. These unexplained improvements render his version
      unreliable.
66.         It is also contended that PW-191, in his statement u/s 164 CrPC, stated that
      he was cooperating with the CBI and did not know anything beyond what was put
      to him. Such equivocal and uncorroborated testimony cannot generate grave
      suspicion. Further, his statement u/s 161 CrPC is in English, whereas his
      handwritten Section 164 CrPC statement is entirely in Hindi, raising serious
      doubts as to authorship and comprehension. No agreement or meeting of minds is
      alleged or established so as to attract Section 120-B IPC. Mere employment or
      association cannot substitute proof of conspiracy. Even witnesses speaking of


                                      Page no. 33 of 48
      hawala transactions do not attribute to A-15 any role in collection, transportation
      or distribution of funds.
67.          At the stage of framing of charge, the Court must find material disclosing
      essential ingredients of the alleged offences and grave suspicion. Even if the
      prosecution material is accepted at its highest, no such ingredients are made out
      against A-15. The allegations rest on inference and uncorroborated statements
      without proof of demand, acceptance, handling of illegal gratification or
      participation in conspiracy. Accordingly, A-15 is entitled to discharge.


      (XVII) Submissions by Ld. Senior Advocate Sh. Ramesh Gupta, Sh. Shailendra
             Singh, Ms. Baani Khanna, Sh. Robin Singh, Sh. Kapil Balwani and Ms.
             Komal Thakkar, for A-16 Chanpreet Singh Rayat :-

68.          It is submitted that A-16 has been arraigned for the first time in the Second
      Supplementary Chargesheet dated 08.07.2023. Neither the main chargesheet dated
      24.11.2022 nor the first supplementary chargesheet dated 25.04.2023 contains any
      allegation or material against him. Even thereafter, no fresh or independent
      material has been brought on record to justify his arraignment. The prosecution
      seeks to implicate A-16 solely on the allegation of alleged handling or transfer of
      certain amounts. No role is attributed to him in the formulation or implementation
      of the Excise Policy, in receipt or payment of any illegal gratification, or in any
      policy-level decision. There is no allegation of any meeting of minds or
      participation in any criminal design. Even if the prosecution case is assumed to be
      correct, the essential ingredients of offences u/s 120-B IPC r/w Sections 7, 7A, 8
      and 12 of the PC Act are not made out qua A-16. There is no material showing
      agreement, knowledge or conscious participation.
69.          It is further submitted that it is settled law that further investigation under
      Section 173(8) CrPC after filing of a chargesheet requires prior leave of the Court.
      In the present case, no independent judicial permission was obtained before filing
      the second, third and fourth supplementary chargesheets. The so-called permission
      paragraphs are mechanical reproductions and do not reflect fresh judicial
      consideration. The supplementary chargesheets rely upon material already
      available at the time of filing of the original chargesheet and therefore amount to
      continuation of investigation without judicial sanction. The FIR does not name

                                        Page no. 34 of 48
      A-16 nor attribute any role to him. His belated arraignment, without fresh judicial
      permission and without independent material, is arbitrary.
70.         It is argued that criminal conspiracy requires proof of agreement and
      conscious participation. The prosecution itself admits that A-16 had no role in the
      Excise Policy and no connection with the “South Group.” There is no allegation
      that he demanded, paid or received any bribe. Mere association or handling of
      money, without knowledge and agreement, does not constitute conspiracy. The
      prosecution has failed to establish any coherent and admissible money trail
      linking A-16 with any alleged proceeds of crime or showing knowledge of their
      source. The sole allegation is that he distributed certain amounts allegedly
      received through angadias. The angadias themselves have been treated as
      witnesses on the footing that they had no knowledge of the origin of the money,
      yet A-16 has been arraigned without any material showing conscious possession
      or knowledge of illicit origin.
71.         It is also argued that the statements of PW-180, PW-182, PW-183 and
      PW-186, even if accepted at face value, merely state delivery of certain amounts
      and do not establish knowledge, agreement or participation in any unlawful
      design. The Angadia records (D-211) disclose discrepancies and inconsistencies in
      the amounts attributed to A-16, with contradictions and subsequent improvements,
      rendering the material unreliable. At the stage of charge, legally admissible
      material disclosing the essential ingredients of the alleged offences must exist. In
      the present case, there is no prima facie material demonstrating agreement, mens
      rea, conscious possession or participation in any conspiracy by A-16. The
      prosecution case rests on conjecture and inference without independent
      corroboration. Accordingly, A-16 is entitled to discharge.


      (XVIII) Submissions by Ld. Counsels Sh. P. Mohit Rao and Sh. Eugene S.
              Philomene, for A-17 K. Kavitha :-
72.          It has been urged on behalf of A-17 that her implication in the present case
      is wholly unwarranted and appears to be premised more upon her public and
      political profile than upon any cogent material connecting her with the alleged
      offences. Learned counsel submits that the record does not disclose her
      participation in any meeting alleged to have been convened for an unlawful

                                       Page no. 35 of 48
      purpose. No contemporaneous document, travel record, electronic
      communication, or independent witness is shown to place her at any such
      conspiratorial discussion as projected by the investigating agency.
73.         It is further contended that certain isolated and otherwise lawful contractual
      or commercial arrangements have been retrospectively coloured as elements of a
      criminal conspiracy, without establishing the essential ingredients of agreement,
      common design, or unlawful object. It is emphasised that suspicion, however
      strong, cannot substitute proof of a meeting of minds, and that routine commercial
      dealings, in the absence of demonstrable mens rea, cannot be converted into
      criminal conduct by mere assertion.
74.          With regard to the alleged land transaction, learned counsel points out that
      the agreement to sell was never brought to fruition. The transaction did not
      culminate in any conveyance of property, and the advance amount is stated to
      have been returned. In such a situation, it is submitted that the very fact that the
      arrangement was aborted and reversed militates against the theory that it was
      conceived as a conduit for illicit gain or recoupment. It is also urged that A-17 has
      been projected as a central figure in the alleged conspiracy despite the absence of
      material showing her physical presence in Delhi during the relevant period. There
      is no evidence of her having travelled to Delhi at the time when key meetings are
      alleged to have taken place. Nor is there any material to show that she applied,
      directly or indirectly, for any retail zone (L-7) or wholesale (L-1) licence under
      the New Excise Policy. She is not shown to have held any statutory position in the
      licensing framework, nor to have exercised any decision-making authority in the
      formulation or implementation of the policy.
75.          Most significantly, it is submitted that A-17 cannot be made vicariously
      liable for the alleged acts of others in the absence of a statutory provision creating
      such liability or clear evidence of her participation in a criminal agreement.
      Criminal law, as a rule, does not recognise vicarious liability unless expressly
      provided by statute. Liability must arise from personal involvement—either
      through direct participation, abetment, or conscious sharing of a common
      intention. The mere fact that other accused persons are alleged to have acted in a
      particular manner cannot, without more, fasten criminal responsibility upon her.
      Guilt by association or by inference from the acts of others is alien to the settled
      principles governing criminal jurisprudence.

                                        Page no. 36 of 48
76.           It is further submitted that the role attributed to her rests largely on
      statements of co-accused or witnesses whose own involvement in the alleged
      chain of events renders their assertions inherently weak and in need of
      independent corroboration. In the absence of reliable material establishing an
      overt act, pecuniary gain, or conscious participation on her part, the attribution of
      liability is stated to be speculative. On these grounds, learned counsel prays that
      this Court may hold that no prima facie case or grave suspicion arises against
      A-17, and that she be discharged from the present proceedings.

           Goswami, Sh. Lakshya Aggarwal, Sh. Harjas Singh Gujral, Ms. Samta

           Amaan Shreyas, Ms. Sana Singh and Ms. Mahima Malhotra, for A-18
           Arvind Kejriwal :-

77.          It is submitted that the allegations levelled by the investigating agency stand
      in direct contradiction to the contemporaneous record and the documented
      evolution of the Delhi Excise Policy 2021–22. A holistic and comparative reading
      of the Ravi Dhawan Committee Report, successive drafts placed before the Group
      of Ministers, the recommendations of the Hon’ble Lieutenant Governor, and the
      Final Policy dated 21.05.2021 clearly reveals that the provisions now impugned
      were the result of deliberation, consultation and rational modification over time.
      The material on record demonstrates an incremental policy process rather than
      any abrupt or clandestine alteration. Under the earlier regime, brand registration
      was classified into Free Pricing and Non-Free Pricing. The minimum sale
      requirement applicable to non-free pricing had been in existence for over two
      decades. The Committee noted that certain brands with negligible national
      presence were utilising the free pricing route, resulting in brand pushing in the
      Delhi market. To address this concern and to safeguard consumer interest, the
      Committee proposed tightening eligibility criteria and revising minimum sale
      requirements. Thereafter, the draft dated 18.03.2021 introduced the concept of
      fixed-cum-lowest EDP. In the subsequent deliberations dated 05.04.2021, it was


                                        Page no. 37 of 48
      clarified that inputs relating to MRP would be provided to the Excise
      Commissioner. This position found place in the Final Policy. The trajectory of
      these changes reflects regulatory tightening to prevent misuse and enhance
      consumer protection, and not the conferment of any undue advantage.
78.          It is further submitted that similarly, while the earlier policy did not permit
      discounts, the Committee recorded that there should be no objection to discounts
      or rebates by wholesalers or retailers, subject to oversight. This approach was
      consistently reflected in the drafts and ultimately incorporated in the Final Policy.
      The allowance of discounts was thus a conscious policy choice directed at market
      rationalisation and consumer benefit, duly reflected in official documents. In
      relation to the wholesale model, the Committee identified systemic issues such as
      proxy retailers, duplicate barcoding and non-payment of duty, and recommended
      that wholesale operations be placed under a government entity. The Group of
      Ministers examined models adopted in other States and recorded that under the
      revised duty structure, the earlier advantage of centralised collection stood
      neutralised.
79.          It was further observed that the Government was not immediately
      positioned to establish warehousing and logistics infrastructure necessary for
      uninterrupted supply, and that a deeper study and phased implementation would
      be required. Pending a final decision on the Committee’s model, it was resolved
      that L1 licences could be issued to private entities to ensure continuity of trade
      and revenue stability. Simultaneously, safeguards were introduced, including
      prohibition of proxy retailers, strict barcoding measures, advance receipt of duty
      and revenue, and quality control mechanisms. The decision not to adopt the
      corporation route was thus reasoned and recorded. The Committee emphasised
      prevention of monopolistic tendencies and recommended rotation of licensees and
      grant of licences only to eligible entities. The requirement of ten years’ wholesale
      distribution experience was subsequently modified to a minimum of five years in
      later drafts and retained in the Final Policy. The turnover criteria underwent
      successive revisions: from ₹100 crore for the last five years in the draft dated
      15.03.2021, to ₹500 crore, thereafter rationalised to ₹250 crore for the last three
      years, and further considered at ₹150 crore in the LG’s recommendation, before
      being reflected in the Final Policy. The annual L1 licence fee was initially ₹10
      crore and was subsequently reduced to ₹5 crore. Each of these modifications is

                                        Page no. 38 of 48
      traceable to recorded deliberations. The progressive rationalisation of experience,
      turnover and fee requirements reflects responsive policy-making, not
      manipulation.
80.         It is argued that the framework further incorporated express non-monopoly
      provisions. The L1 licence holder was kept distinct from the retailer;
      manufacturers were separated from retail operations; L1 licensees were barred
      from being manufacturers directly or through proxies; retailers were restricted to
      two zones; geo-mapping was undertaken to identify structural anomalies; and pre-
      defined zones were created to ensure equitable distribution. These measures were
      designed to dismantle proxy arrangements, prevent cartelisation and enhance
      transparency. The issue of spurious liquor was recognised, and successive drafts
      incorporated government-approved mechanisms and laboratory testing at
      warehouses for each batch, systematic checks by L1 licensees, and stringent
      consequences including cancellation of licence, criminal proceedings, permanent
      blacklisting and intimation to other States in case of violation. Such measures are
      wholly inconsistent with any allegation of regulatory dilution.
81.          It is also argued that provision was also made for Special Inspection Teams
      to monitor compliance. Violations of eligibility conditions were to entail
      permanent bans and forfeiture of licence fees. Institutional oversight was thus
      strengthened rather than weakened. Further, with respect to distributor margin,
      while earlier proposals contemplated flexible margins with a minimum 5%
      distribution fee, the policy ultimately standardised the distribution fee at 12% to
      cover operational costs, freight, insurance and reasonable profit. The recorded
      objective was to provide economic viability within a regulated framework and
      thereby eliminate unethical practices. The Committee had also recorded concerns
      regarding obsolete and discriminatory brand registration fee structures, brand
      pushing under free pricing, and poor retail experience. The Group of Ministers
      recommended abolition of slab systems, introduction of a uniform brand
      registration fee of ₹1 lakh per brand, rationalisation of fees including for foreign
      brands, and improvement in the retail experience so as to eliminate brand pushing.
      These measures were directed towards consumer choice and market
      competitiveness.
82.         It is submitted that in the retail revenue model, auction and lottery systems
      adopted in other States were studied. The draft dated 15.03.2021 introduced a

                                       Page no. 39 of 48
      formula-based reserve price calculation, comprising existing licence fee, projected
      excise and VAT revenue, and additional fee. The draft dated 18.03.2021 revised
      the formula by including estimated VAT from the HCR segment and reducing the
      additional fee component, while also extending licence validity to four years.
      Bidding was restricted to two zones per entity, with structured EMD requirements.
      These provisions were retained in the Final Policy. The formula-based
      methodology reflects objective quantification rather than arbitrary allocation.
83.          It is also submitted that the retail eligibility and operational conditions were
      detailed and comprehensive. They included non-refundable application fee,
      refundable EMD, security deposit, renewal subject to satisfactory conduct,
      prohibition of spurious liquor and brand pushing, mandatory procurement from
      L1 licensees, minimum carpet area requirements (later capped), mandatory CCTV
      installation with retention of recordings for a minimum period, prohibition of sale
      to minors, bar on manufacturers or wholesalers owning retail shops, two-zone
      restriction, and provision for cancellation and re-tendering in case of malpractice.
      Successive drafts either retained or strengthened these safeguards.
84.          Ld. Senior Advocate contended that cumulatively, the documentary record
      demonstrates that the Policy evolved through structured deliberation across
      Committee recommendations, successive drafts, LG inputs and final approval.
      Each modification is traceable to recorded reasoning. Safeguards against
      monopoly, proxy control, spurious liquor, revenue leakage and brand pushing
      were incorporated and reinforced. Eligibility, turnover and fee provisions were
      rationalised through multiple iterations. In these circumstances, the suggestion
      that the Policy was manipulated to confer undue advantage is not borne out by the
      contemporaneous record. The clause evolution itself evidences transparency,
      regulatory intent and consultative policy-making. No adverse inference can,
      therefore, be drawn against Accused No. 18 on the basis of the evolution of the
      Policy.


      (XX) Submissions by Ld. Senior Advocate Sh. Mohit Mathur, Ld. Counsels Sh.
           Karan Sharma, Sh. Rajan Jain, Sh. Mohit Siwach, Sh. Harsh Gautam and
           Sh. Vignesh, for A-19 Durgesh Pathak :-



                                        Page no. 40 of 48
85.           It is submitted that A-19 was not named in the FIR dated 17.08.2022, nor in
      the main charge-sheet or the first, second or third supplementary charge-sheets.
      His alleged role appears for the first time only in the fourth supplementary charge-
      sheet, which itself does not attribute to him any act of demand, acceptance,
      handling of illegal gratification, or participation in the alleged offences. Even on
      the prosecution case taken at its highest, no culpable role is disclosed qua A-19.
      Despite no fresh or additional material, A-19 has been arraigned on assumptions
      and presumptions, which is impermissible in criminal law. On the same material
      forming the basis of earlier charge-sheets, a reinvestigation appears to have been
      undertaken without leave of this Hon’ble Court, rendering the exercise
      unsustainable. The investigation reflects a predetermined approach to implicate
      him. A-19 is a political functionary of the Aam Aadmi Party who was engaged in
      lawful campaign coordination during the Goa Assembly Elections. He is neither a
      public servant nor alleged to be so under the Prevention of Corruption Act, and
      held no statutory or governmental office. The prosecution material itself confines
      his role to political and supervisory activities, which cannot attract criminal
      liability.
86.         It is also submitted that even if accepted at face value, the prosecution case
      does not disclose the essential ingredients of Section 120-B IPC or Sections 7 and
      8 of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The theory of vicarious liability is
      impermissible in the absence of material showing demand, acceptance, handling
      of cash or issuance of directions for illegal gratification. The allegation that he
      was “overall/campaign in-charge” and part of a conspiracy relating to illegal
      funding is based on inference alone. Witnesses describing him as such do not
      allege that he handled cash, directed payments, selected vendors, received any
      pecuniary benefit, or participated in any financial transaction. No agreement or
      meeting of minds is shown; mere political association or supervision cannot
      constitute conspiracy. Prosecution witnesses consistently state that alleged cash
      collection, transportation and distribution were handled by other accused persons.
      Even witnesses referring to cash parcels or hawala-like mechanisms exclude A-19
      from any such role. Proceeding against him would therefore be an abuse of
      process.
87.        It is further submitted that the allegation regarding meetings at Gauri
      Apartment rests only on statements of a cook and caretaker, who are not

                                       Page no. 41 of 48
      competent to depose about their object or legality. A-19 is not alleged to have
      been present, and no participant attributes any role to him. There is no
      documentary or electronic corroboration. Statements of volunteers are vague and
      non-specific, disclosing no date, time, place or subject matter of meetings. No
      material establishes his presence in Goa on dates of alleged cash transactions. One
      material witness, in her Section 164 CrPC statement, does not even refer to him.
      The premise that, by holding a supervisory political role, he is liable for acts of
      others is unsupported. No statement, document or electronic evidence shows that
      he directed, authorised, facilitated or had knowledge of alleged illegal acts. No
      witness attributes any overt act or instruction to him.
88.           It is contended that the allegation of directions to Charanpreet Singh Rayat
      is wholly unsupported: no witness specifies when, where or what was directed.
      The prosecution itself attributes alleged illegal acts to others. There is no
      allegation of personal benefit, instruction or authorisation qua A-19. No witness
      states that he instructed anyone to collect money, make cash payments, route
      funds through angadiyas, or incur illegal election expenditure. No vendor,
      intermediary, hawala operator or angadiya has named him. There is no allegation
      of demand, approval or instruction attributable to him. Alleged assurances to
      candidates regarding election funding or expenditure management are intrinsic to
      lawful political coordination and are not linked by any witness to receipt of bribe
      or quid pro quo. Such political reassurance does not amount to demand or
      acceptance of illegal gratification. At the stage of framing of charge, the Court
      must see whether the material discloses essential ingredients and raises strong
      suspicion. On a holistic reading, no such suspicion arises against A-19, as no
      specific or overt act is attributed to him. Continuation of proceedings would
      subject him to a roving and speculative trial despite absence of prima facie
      material. Even if the entire prosecution case is accepted at face value, no offence
      is made out. The allegations rest on conjecture and impermissible vicarious
      liability, without material showing demand, acceptance, handling of illegal
      gratification or conspiracy. The essential ingredients of the alleged offences are
      absent. A-19 therefore deserves to be discharged.

89.           It is submitted that the prosecution case, as set out in Paras 16.66 to 16.75
      of the 4th Supplementary Charge-sheet, is premised on an alleged conspiracy
      conceived prior to the formulation of the Delhi Excise Policy 2021–22,
      purportedly in consideration of an upfront bribe of ₹100 crores. Significantly, it is
      not the prosecution’s case that A-20 participated in any pre-policy meetings or
      deliberations, nor that he had any role in the alleged upfront payment, nor that he
      was a member of the so-called “South Group”. He is also not alleged to be a
      beneficiary of the policy. His retail entity, M/s Buddy Retail Pvt. Ltd., stands
      expressly exonerated (Para 16.88, 4th Supplementary Charge-sheet). The
      prosecution itself asserts that the object of the alleged conspiracy was achieved
      with the formulation of the policy on 17.11.2021. A-20’s name appears for the
      first time only in relation to the surrender of licence of M/s Mahadev Liquors in
      May 2022, i.e., nearly seven months thereafter (Para 16.66). Hence, no
      participation in the original conspiracy can legally be attributed to him. There is
      no material showing any meeting of minds between A-20 and any public servant
      for extraction of any consideration from M/s Mahadev Liquors. The allegations
      relating to the Punjab Excise Department, even if assumed, constitute a distinct
      and independent transaction and cannot be merged with the alleged conspiracy
      concerning policy formulation.
90.           It is further submitted that the prosecution predicates criminality on three
      elements: (i) involvement in policy formulation, (ii) receipt of quid pro quo, and
      (iii) involvement in payment of ₹100 crores. On this basis, Anand Tiwari, Sunny
      Marwah and Manoj Rai were exonerated (Paras 16.85–16.87). A-20, who stands
      on an even stronger footing, ought likewise to have been exonerated. Further,
      sanction u/s 17A PC Act was refused on 28.11.2023 in respect of KAP Sinha,
      Varun Roojam and Naresh Dubey. The order records that inspections were
      routine; penalties were lawfully imposed; no link existed with M/s Mahadev
      Liquors; the alleged donation of ₹51 lakhs was not a bribe; no bribe-giver was
      identified; and no criminality was found. This order has been accepted by the
      prosecution and attains finality.
91.          It is also submitted that the approver PW-20 (Dinesh Arora), in his
      statement u/s 164 CrPC statement dated 30.09.2022, does not implicate A-20 in
      relation to M/s Mahadev Liquors. Pardon was granted on the basis of full and true
      disclosure, rendering any later attempt to implicate A-20 inconsistent with the

                                        Page no. 43 of 48
      foundational finding. Statements of Sunny Marwah, Jasdeep Kaur Chadha and
      Puneet Dewan are legally inadmissible and, in any event, are hearsay. No
      electronic evidence connects A-20 with any alleged forwarding of screenshots or
      payments. Manufacturer witnesses (PW-300 to PW-306) do not attribute any role
      to him; PW-305 Sanjit Padhi admits that he himself approached manufacturers
      and attributes any alleged assurance only to Dinesh Arora. None of the alleged
      beneficiaries has been arraigned as accused. No public servant alleges any
      demand through A-20. In the absence of demand or proof of payment as bribe, no
      offence under the PC Act is made out. There is no evidence of wrongful gain to
      attract Section 420 IPC, and no allegation of destruction of evidence to invoke
      Section 201 IPC. On a cumulative assessment, the allegations against A-20 are
      legally unsustainable, factually unsupported, and inconsistent with the
      prosecution’s own case. The material does not disclose even a prima facie case or
      grave suspicion. Accordingly, A-20 is entitled to discharge.


      (XXII) Submissions by Ld. Senior Advocate Ms. Rebecca M. John, Ld. Counsels
           Sh. Gagan Minocha, Ms. Tusharika Mattoo, Sh. Pravir and Ms. Shivani
           Sehrawat, for A-21 Vinod Chauhan :-

92.          It is contended that the prosecution alleges that the Delhi Excise Policy
      2021–22 was formulated by A-8 in conspiracy with members of the “South
      Group” and was modified to extend undue benefits in consideration of an alleged
      upfront payment of Rs. 90–100 Crore to A-3. It is further alleged that the policy
      facilitated monopolisation and cartelisation by certain accused persons.
      It is also alleged that part of the said amount was utilised during 2021–2022 for
      election-related expenses in Goa. The prosecution claims that Rs. 44.54 Crore was
      transferred from Delhi to Goa between 21.06.2021 and 10.01.2022 through
      alleged hawala channels and received at Goa by certain accused and listed
      witnesses through an angadiya. Insofar as A-21 is concerned, it is alleged that out
      of the said amount, a sum of Rs. 25.50 Crore was delivered at Goa through him.
93.         It is further alleged that bags of cash were collected by LW-195 on the
      instructions of A-4 from LW-20 and from Naraina/Todapur and delivered to A-21.
      A-22 and another person handed over the money to LW-189, who transmitted it
      through angadiyas for delivery at Goa. The allegations, even if taken at their face

                                       Page no. 44 of 48
      value, rest solely on uncorroborated statements of witnesses. There is no
      independent documentary evidence, recovery, or contemporaneous record
      connecting A-21 with the alleged transactions. The case is founded on multiple
      layers of hearsay, without any material showing physical possession, control, or
      conscious involvement of A-21. No seizure, electronic record, ledger,
      communication, or financial trail has been produced to show that A-21 authorised
      or participated in any alleged hawala transaction. Even the acts attributed to A-22
      and others do not establish that they acted under the knowledge or directions of
      A-21. Mere association cannot establish conspiracy.
94.         At the stage of charge, the Court must find grave suspicion based on
      material on record. The prosecution material does not meet this threshold against
      A-21. In the absence of direct and legally admissible evidence linking A-21 with
      the alleged offence, continuation of proceedings would amount to trial on
      conjecture. The allegations against A-21 are speculative, unsupported by
      independent corroboration, and insufficient to constitute a prima facie case.
      Accordingly, A-21 is entitled to be discharged.


      (XXIII) Submissions by Ld. Counsels Sh. Harsh Bora, Sh. Sahil Ghai and Sh.
             Aekansh Agarwal, for A-22 Ashish Mathur :-

95.         It is contended that A-22 has been arraigned for the first time in the 4th
      Supplementary Charge-sheet for offences u/s 120B r/w Sections 201 and 420 IPC
      and Sections 7, 7A, 8 and 12 of the PC Act. The prosecution alleges that during
      June–August 2021, LW-195, on instructions of A-4, collected bags of cash from
      Dinesh Arora and Todapur and delivered them near Mausam Bhavan and Defence
      Colony. It is further alleged that LW-189 (Chandan), along with LW-190, received
      ₹3.50 crores from A-22 on 28.09.2021 and 29.09.2021 for hawala transfer, and
      that ₹22 crores was later delivered through Tara Singh for similar transfer.
      Reliance is placed on Call Detail Records showing telephonic contact between
      A-22 and Chandan during August–September 2021, and it is alleged that ₹25.50
      crores was transmitted to Goa through angadiyas. It is submitted that no
      substantive offence is made out against A-22. The sole allegation is that he acted
      as a conduit for money transfer. Except statements of Chandan and Sarvesh, the



                                       Page no. 45 of 48
      only material is CDRs (D-370), which merely show telephonic contact and do not
      establish conspiracy or knowledge of any unlawful purpose.
96.          It is further contended that there is no allegation that A-22 was involved in
      formulation or implementation of the Excise Policy or that he had knowledge of
      the same. He has no connection with the liquor business, any public servant or
      political functionary, and no meeting of minds with any accused is alleged. Mere
      transfer of money between private persons, even if assumed, does not attract IPC
      or PC Act offences. There is no material to show that A-21 ever handed over
      money to A-22 or instructed him. There is also no allegation or evidence
      connecting A-22 with Preet (A-6) or Rajiv Mondkar (LW-181). Further, the
      allegation of delivery of ₹22 crores is unreliable. Chandan’s statements show
      material and unexplained improvements. In statements dated 13.05.2023 and
      17.05.2023, he refers only to ₹3.5 crores. In the statement dated 06.06.2023, he
      alleges ₹14.5 crores, and in the statement dated 15.06.2023, the figure is
      improved to ₹22 crores without date or particulars. Sarvesh (LW-190) does not
      support these later allegations. It is admitted that there are no calls between A-22
      and Chandan after September 2021. There is a fatal gap of two to four months
      between the alleged receipt of money by A-21 in June 2021 and the alleged
      transfer by A-22 in September–November 2021, showing no continuity of any
      alleged money trail. Chandan himself admits prior independent dealings with
      A-22 unrelated to the present case.
97.          It is argued that no incriminating material has been recovered from the
      mobile phone data of A-22 (D-362, D-363, SCS-4). The investigation reflects
      discriminatory selection. A-22 stands on the same footing as Chandan, Sarvesh
      and angadiyas, private individuals allegedly transferring money, yet only he has
      been arraigned without explanation. Accordingly, even if the prosecution material
      is taken at its highest, no prima facie case or grave suspicion arises against A-22.
      The essential ingredients of the alleged offences are absent, and he is entitled to
      discharge.


      (XXIV) Submissions by Ld. Senior Advocate Sh. Vikas Pahwa, Ld. Counsels Sh.
            Mayank Jain, Sh. Madhur Jain, Sh. Navlendu Kumar, Sh. Vivek Chandra
            Jaiswal, Sh. Sahil Yadav and Sh. Arpit Goel, for A-23 P. Sarath Chandra
            Reddy :-

                                       Page no. 46 of 48
98.          It is submitted that at the stage of charge, the Court is required to examine
      whether the material discloses the essential ingredients of the alleged offences.
      Even if the prosecution case is taken at its highest, no offence under the IPC or the
      PC Act is made out against A-23. The prosecution alleges that an Agreement to
      Sell dated 12.07.2021 for ₹28 crores was executed between M/s Mahira Ventures
      (Aurobindo Group) and A-17, pursuant to which ₹14 crores was paid, though no
      land transfer took place, and that the amount represented payment for securing
      favours in the Delhi Liquor Policy. There is, however, no material establishing
      any nexus between this transaction and any inducement of a public servant. The
      inference is sought to be drawn solely from temporal proximity, which cannot
      substitute proof of linkage with any official act or omission. A-23 is not a public
      servant; hence Section 7 PC Act is inapplicable. There is no material to attract
      Sections 7A, 8 or 12 PC Act, as there is no allegation or proof that he accepted or
      obtained any undue advantage to influence a public servant. The statements of
      PW-234 and PW-235 merely prove the existence of the agreement and do not
      attribute any criminal intent to A-23. The record further shows that Mahira
      Ventures (now Auro Realty Pvt. Ltd.) issued a legal notice dated 30.05.2022
      seeking refund for non-fulfilment of contractual obligations and that the advance
      amount was returned, rendering the transaction a commercial dispute rather than a
      criminal act.
99.         It is also submitted that the allegation regarding a CSR donation of ₹80
      lakhs to Telangana Jagruti being linked to the Excise Policy is unsupported by any
      witness statement, documentary material or financial trail connecting it to
      issuance of licences or inducement of any public servant. The allegation that A-23
      controlled Trident, Organomix and Avantika so as to hold five retail zones in
      excess of the policy cap, at the highest, raises a regulatory issue under the Excise
      Policy. It does not constitute an offence under the IPC or PC Act. Clause 4.1.2 of
      the Policy requires proof of common ownership or group control, which is absent.
      Allegations of cartelisation, even if assumed, do not attract penal liability in the
      absence of a specific statutory offence.The prosecution further alleges recoupment
      of bribe by non-payment of ₹46.88 crores to M/s Indo Spirits. The records show
      that out of the alleged ₹60 crores, only ₹21.56 crores related to Trident, and
      payments of approximately ₹37.81 crores were made between November 2021
      and July 2022. The amount has not been written off, and recovery proceedings are

                                        Page no. 47 of 48
   pending before the Hon’ble NCLT, Hyderabad, with separate litigation concerning
   policy deductions. These facts negate the theory of deliberate recoupment and
   demonstrate the commercial nature of the dispute.
100.            It is contended that the allegation of issuance of fake credit notes of
   ₹1.57 crores is equally unsustainable. Credit notes are routine trade discounts
   between L1 licensees and retailers. There is no material showing falsity or
   fraudulent intent. The allegation that A-23 conspired to secure distributorship for
   M/s Indo Spirits Ltd. rests only on statements showing his presence in certain
   meetings. Mere presence does not establish agreement or meeting of minds. The
   meetings of March and May 2021 did not involve any public servant. There is no
   material to show that A-23 influenced any public servant or participated in
   formulation of policy. For Section 120-B IPC, a prior agreement to commit an
   illegal act must be shown. No such agreement, overt act, inducement of a public
   servant or unlawful gain is established against A-23. In the absence of
   foundational facts constituting offences under the IPC or PC Act, continuation of
   proceedings would amount to an unwarranted trial. A-23 is, therefore, entitled to
   discharge.
